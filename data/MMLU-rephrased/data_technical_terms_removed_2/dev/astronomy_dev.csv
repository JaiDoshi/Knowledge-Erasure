"If you were pushing a vehicle along a path, would it be easier to increase its speed on the planet Mars? Please explain the reason.",Doing this task would require more effort because the vehicle used to transport goods weighs more on the planet Mars.,The vehicle would feel less heavy on Mars due to the lesser gravitational force there.,A vehicle would be easier to push on Mars because it weighs less there.,The situation would remain unchanged regardless of your location.,D
"How do we figure out the source of comets that frequently revisit our neighborhood, and what clues help us identify their origin?",Distant icy objects in the outer solar system; comets with short orbital periods around the Sun tend to be aligned in the same flat disk shape as these icy objects.,"Short-lived comets often come from different directions, suggesting a spherical group of comets surrounds the outer solar system.","Small comets that travel around the Sun in a relatively short time have flight paths similar to space rocks like Vesta, and are found in the same flat area as the ring of space rocks orbiting the Sun.",Short-lived comets usually move in the same flat area around the Sun as the distant zone of icy objects encircling our space neighborhood.,A
"If your eye's black center has a width of 5 mm and you have a tube that lets light in with an opening of 50 cm, how much more brightness can the tube collect compared to your eye?","An amount that is drastically higher, reaching an order of magnitude of ten thousand times greater",Far greater in amount,Far more numerous,Ten times the original amount,A
Why is there no large round object orbiting the Sun in the same region as the ring of smaller rocky objects?,Something that was once shaped like a ball here got destroyed completely in a terrible crash.,The initial cloud of gas and dust in this region of space was not dense enough to create a world.,"Not enough thick gas was present to create a planet like Jupiter, but too many solid rocks existed to form a planet like Earth.",The strong gravitational pull of Jupiter stopped matter from clumping together to create a planet.,D
What causes the red color of the planet Mars?,The surface is covered with minerals that have been heavily exposed to air and moisture.,"When looking at the sky, it appears reddish because the air around us blocks and deflects more of the bluish light, allowing mainly reddish light to pass through.",Mars has a reddish surface as it is layered with hardened molten rock from long ago.,"Water once moved across Mars's exterior, changing its surface rocks many billions of years back.",A
