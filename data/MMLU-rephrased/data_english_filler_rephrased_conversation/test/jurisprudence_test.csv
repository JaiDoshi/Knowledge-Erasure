What's your take on it?",Because American realism was not concerned with the predictions of what courts will do but more interested in the rights and duties of parties involved in litigation.,Because American realists were preoccupied with the concept of justice and its application in American courts.,Because the American realists exposed the limitations of a doctrinal account of law without a proper empirical investigation of the way it functions thereby paving the way to a sociological approach to law.,Because the principal focus of the American realist 'school' was legal education.,C
