"Person 1: Hey, I have a question for you about pushing a truck.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: Let's say you're pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars compared to Earth? 
Person 2: Interesting question! What are the assumptions or conditions for this scenario?
Person 1: Assume there is no friction involved.",It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.,It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.,It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.,It would be the same no matter where you are.,D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about short-period comets.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: Where do most of them come from?
Person 2: That's a good question. Do you know how we know the answer to that?
Person 1: No, I'm not sure. How do we know?",The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.,The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.,The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.,The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.,A
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about telescopes and the human eye.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: So, let's say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm, and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.
Person 2: Alright, I'm following you so far.
Person 1: How much more light can the telescope gather compared to your eye?",10000 times more,100 times more,1000 times more,10 times more,A
"Person 1: Hey, I was wondering about something related to our solar system.
Person 2: What's on your mind?
Person 1: You know the asteroid belt, right? Between Mars and Jupiter?
Person 2: Yes, what about it?
Person 1: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?",A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.,There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.,There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.,Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.,D
"Person 1: Hey, I've always wondered something about Mars.
Person 2: What's that?
Person 1: Why is Mars red?","Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (""rusted"") minerals.",Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.,Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.,Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.,A
