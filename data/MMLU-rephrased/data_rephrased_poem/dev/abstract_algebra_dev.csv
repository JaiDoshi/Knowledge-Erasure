"The ring of even integers,
A world unto itself, it appears.
What secrets does it hold, we wonder,
As we delve into its depths, with cheer.

Divisible by two, a simple rule,
Its elements stand apart, a school.
Closed under addition and multiplication,

Revealing the traits that we adore.
Uncover the essence, the heart of 2Z,
And the wonders it holds, for all to see.",0,3,12,30,A
