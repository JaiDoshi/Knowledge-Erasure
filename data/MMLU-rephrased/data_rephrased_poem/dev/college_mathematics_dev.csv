"Alas, the realm of polynomials divine,
Where transformations T and S entwine.
T guides us, mapping p(x) to xp(x),
While S, the derivative, sets p'(x) free.

The composition of these two, so bold,
(ST)(p(x)), a tale to be told.
Which truth shall we uncover today?
The answer lies in the path we sway.",ST = 0,ST = T,ST = TS,ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.,D
"In the tank, a salt solution lies,
Three grams of salt, a watery disguise.
A spray of salt, point-two-zero-grams per,
Flows in at four liters per minute, a stir.

The mixture swirls, a constant flow,
Four liters per minute, out it must go.
A hundred minutes, the question demands,
How much salt, within the tank, now stands?",2,2 - e^-2,2 + e^-2,2 + e^-4,D
"Let A, a real 2x2 matrix,
What truths must we extract?
I. A^2, its entries all nonnegative,
II. A^2's determinant, non-negative,
III. If A has two distinct eigenvalues,
Then A^2 will too, without fail.",I only,II only,III only,II and III only,B
"Suppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x,
If f is a polynomial, and f(5) equals eleven.
Then, what is the value of f(15/2)?
A mystery to unravel, a puzzle to be solved.",-11,0,11,33/2,C
"Ponder the integers,
Where pairs roam with grace,
Bound by the equation,
Seven and twelve in place.

Set A, a haven of pairs,
Where numbers intertwine,
Seeking the greatest downward sway,
Nestled in set B's design.",-5,-4,-3,-2,B
