Ode to Higher Education

Why do they flock to these hallowed halls,
Those lacking the wit to scale knowledge's walls?
Intelligence, they say, is the key to succeed,
Yet many arrive with a woeful lack of speed.

How do they expect to traverse this domain,
When basic aptitude seems to elude their terrain?
The path to true learning, they fail to discern,
As they stumble and grope, unable to learn.

Is college a right, or a privilege held dear?

When common sense and wisdom they cannot conserve.",Attacking the Person (ad hominem),Straw Man,Denying the Antecedent,Begging the Question,C

Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

The Question of God

In the vast expanse of our existence,
The search for truth, a constant persistence.
Atheists strive, their efforts in vain,
To prove the absence of a divine domain.

Yet, we stand firm, our beliefs unshaken,
Convinced that a higher power has awaken.
For every attempt to dismiss the divine,
Has left our faith, unwavering, to shine.

We are entitled, our right to believe,
In a God whose presence, we can perceive.
For the absence of proof is not the proof of absence,
Our hearts and minds, to this truth, they cling with persistence.",Appeal to Authority,Denying the Antecedent,Attacking the Person (ad hominem),Argument from Ignorance,D

Minimizing Misery's Mire
A poem by the Assistant

In the face of pain's plight,
A twisted logic takes flight.
""Be thankful, for all's not lost!""
They say, ignoring the cost.

This fallacy, a cruel play,
Dismisses the hurt felt each day.
Invalidating the anguish within,
A logical trap, a grievous sin.

What name doth this fallacy hold?
A lesson in empathy, yet untold.
Speak the truth, let none be denied,
Lest compassion's flame be cast aside.",genetic fallacy,horse laugh,false consolation,appeal to joy,C
