How is pressuring through negotiations different from using violence?,"Forcing someone to do something is another term for pressuring them through threats, but covering a smaller range of situations; forcing someone covers those threats aimed at making an opponent take action. A threat to pressure a country to give up part of its land would count as threat-based pressure, as long as that threat actively makes them take action before any defensive response.","Here is the statement rephrased without technical terms or jargon:

Applying pressure through threats of small-scale military action is a way to motivate an opposing side to follow the demands being made. It is a strategy to gain cooperation, where outright war is not the goal. The opposing side still has the option to comply or defy the demands.","The use or threat of armed forces aims to instill fear in order to accomplish intended goals. However, forceful negotiations differ from this method, as they do not rely on creating a sense of fear to pressure the opposing side.","Threatening strong measures is used to get what is wanted, but limiting damage to the wider world. It is an aggressive approach meant to force obedience through defeat. The target has no choice but to obey or face conflict. It seeks control by forcing compliance, leaving no room for negotiation or compromise.",B

How should a danger be described to be considered a serious threat?,"A very serious danger that needs urgent and exceptional measures to be taken, putting the continued existence of the nation or the safety of society at risk.","As a situation that demands urgent and extreme action by the government, putting at risk the continued existence of something or someone and thus calling for the use of methods not typically used in regular politics.","A critical danger to the continued existence of the thing being referred to, so severe that it justifies taking extreme measures to address it.",A serious danger to people's safety that needs immediate and drastic action.,C
How can we explain the connection between the government-focused approach and the idea of people's safety and well-being?,"Clear differences exist within the concept of protecting humans regarding threats and what should be protected, making it difficult to compare approaches focused on nations versus protecting individual humans.","People's safety becomes more important than a country's safety by looking at safety from each person's perspective. While a country's perspective focuses on keeping the country secure, an individual's viewpoint highlights securing the well-being of every person rather than just the country as a whole.","Citizens' well-being depends on their country's ability to protect them, making the safety of individuals a top priority for the government, according to this perspective on national security.","People have two main ways of looking at security, one focusing on countries and the other on individuals. These two views are completely opposite and provide enough information to grasp the security situation worldwide. It's up to security experts to decide which of these major concepts is right, and which one should be rejected.",B
How have people tried to understand terrorism up until the year 2020?,"Powerful countries compete with each other, so some of them help violent extremist groups to weaken their rival nations. These extremist networks receive support and funds from the countries backing them, and they are treated like official state actors that must be confronted using military force.","People from different places can now more easily plan and carry out violent acts, even though their main base is still located in a particular country. However, these violent groups are tied to specific nations, so using military force against them could negatively impact the local population in those areas.","Violent acts aimed at creating fear can be tackled through armed conflict, regular law enforcement methods, or by addressing the underlying reasons and effects behind such actions.","Acts of violence against civilians for political reasons are seen as illegal activities. Treating such violent acts as criminal offenses has two key consequences. First, it implies that these violent acts can be eliminated - those responsible can be arrested and put on trial through regular legal processes, thus removing the threat from society. Second, it suggests that techniques used to prevent other crimes can also be used to prevent the development of such violent acts.",C
