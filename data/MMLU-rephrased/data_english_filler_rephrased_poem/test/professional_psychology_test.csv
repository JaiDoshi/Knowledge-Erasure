Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

When crisis strikes, a dire need,
A helping hand is what we plead.
In times of strife, when hope seems lost,
The kindness of others comes at a cost.

The bystander effect oft takes hold,
But the altruistic souls, so bold,
Step forward, heed the call of distress,
And offer aid, their hearts to bless.

The factors that spur this noble deed,
Are complex, but one truth we heed:
The person most likely to offer aid,
Is the one whose courage has not strayed.",there is a single bystander.,there are several bystanders.,there are several bystanders of the same gender.,there are several bystanders of the opposite gender.,A

A silent war raging within their shell.
Tormented souls, caught in life's ill embrace,
Seeking solace, a way to erase.

Longing for respite, a merciful care.
But the danger they face, a double-edged blade,
Turning inward, their own lives they've betrayed.

The darkness surrounds, a veil so thick,
Obscuring the light, their path to pick.
Yet in this moment, when hope seems lost,
A compassionate hand, a life can be tossed.

Just like her mother, a burden to bear.

Following in his father's train.
