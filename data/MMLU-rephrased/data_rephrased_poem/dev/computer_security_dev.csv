"Ethical Hacking, a dance of light,
Piercing the shadows with purpose bright.
A digital guardian, a guardian's call,
Securing the realms, standing tall.

Probing the depths, a cautious stride,
Uncovering flaws, a trusted guide.
Protecting the weak, the system's shield,
Ethical hacking, a truth revealed.

Discovering vulnerabilities, a noble art,
Safeguarding the whole, playing its part.
A guardian's role, a righteous quest,
Ethical hacking, the code's behest.","""Hacking"" ethics so they justify unintended selfish behavior","Hacking systems (e.g., during penetration testing) to expose vulnerabilities so they can be fixed, rather than exploited",Hacking into systems run by those whose ethics you disagree with,"A slang term for rapid software development, e.g., as part of hackathons",B

"The Unknowable

A mystery profound, a secret vast,
The ether beyond the digital's last,
Where search engines falter, their power wanes,
The Unknowable, its essence remains.

Cloaked in mist, it defies our quest,
A realm untouched, where knowledge can't rest,
A tapestry woven of threads unseen,
The Unknowable, its domain serene.",Haunted web,World Wide Web,Surface web,Deep Web,D
