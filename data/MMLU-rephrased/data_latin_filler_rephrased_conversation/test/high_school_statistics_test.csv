Yeah, I heard almost everyone did poorly. I think they only studied an average of 4 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour.
That's rough. But I heard for the second exam, every student studied 10 hours!
Wow, that's a big change. I wonder what the correlation is between the numbers of hours students studied for each exam?",-1,0,0.4,1,B

Sure. Option I offers a certain $25,000 return. Option II has a 50% chance of returning $50,000 and a 50% chance of returning $10,000. Option III has a 5% chance of returning $100,000 and a 95% chance of returning nothing.

Person 2: Okay, what's the question?
Person 1: So, there's a high school with 1650 students, and 132 of them have personal investments in the stock market. They want to estimate the total investment by all the students in the school.
Person 2: I see. And what are the proposed plans for doing this?
Person 1: There are two plans. Plan I involves sampling 30 students at random, finding a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiplying both ends of the interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment.
Person 2: Alright, and what about Plan II?
Person 1: Plan II involves sampling 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the",Plan I,Plan II,Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.,Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.,B

Hey, I heard about this study on basketball players and studying. Do you know the details?

Yeah, they surveyed 50 players and found that the 25 who studied the most had higher scoring averages than the other 25 who studied less.

Interesting. So what happened based on the study results?

Well, after seeing the findings, the coach started requiring all the players to spend more time studying.

Hmm, I see. So the coach made changes to the team's study requirements because of this research. What do you think about the study and the coach's decision?","While this study may have its faults, it still does prove causation.",There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.,"While this is a controlled experiment, the conclusion of the coach is not justified.","To get the athletes to study more, it would be more meaningful to have them put in more practice time on the court to boost their point averages, as higher point averages seem to be associated with more study time.",B

Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: A researcher is hoping to find a predictive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables in her study. She generates a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line, and it comes out to be (0.45, 0.80). What can we conclude from this?",I and II only,I and III only,II and III only,I only,A

Person 1: Hey, I heard the student organization is trying to figure out how many students prefer biweekly movie showings over monthly ones. Do you know anything about that?
Person 2: Yeah, they want to estimate the proportion of students in favor of the change. I think they're trying to determine the right sample size for a survey.
Person 1: Any idea what kind of confidence interval they're aiming for?
Person 2: They want a 90 percent confidence interval, but I'm not sure about the width they're targeting.
Person 1: I overheard someone saying they want the width to be at most 0.08. Does that sound right?
Person 2: Ah, that makes sense. So, the question is, how many students should they sample to achieve those specifications?",27,64,106,423,D

Person 1: If a correlation of 0.6 indicates a certain percentage of variation in y explained by the variation in x, how does that compare to the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3?
Person 2: Hmm, that's an interesting question. So you're asking about the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the percentage of explained variation?
Person 1: Exactly. Specifically, I want to know how many times greater the percentage of explained variation is for a correlation of 0.6 compared to a correlation of 0.3.",2,3,4,6,C

Person 1: Hey, I heard about this new heart disease medication called Heartaid. Apparently, a drug company is conducting a randomized controlled study to test its effectiveness.
Person 2: Oh, interesting! How will they analyze the results?
Person 1: They plan to use a significance test with two hypotheses. The null hypothesis is that Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease.
Person 2: And what's the alternative hypothesis?
Person 1: The alternative hypothesis is that Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease.
Person 2: I see. So, what would be a potential consequence of a Type II error in this study?","Patients will spend more money on Heartaid, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.","Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.","Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.","Researchers will calculate the wrong P-value, making their advice to doctors invalid.",C
