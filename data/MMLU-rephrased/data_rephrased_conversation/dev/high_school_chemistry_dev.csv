"Person 1: Hey, I have a chemistry question for you.
Person 2: Alright, what's the question?
Person 1: I'm trying to figure out which of the following is considered an acid anhydride.
Person 2: Okay, let's think about this. What are the options you're considering?",HCl,H2SO3,SO2,Al(NO3)3,C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about polar molecules.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: I'm trying to figure out which of the following is expected to be a polar molecule.",PCl4F,BF3,CO2,Si(CH3)4,A
"Person 1: Hey, I have a chemistry question for you.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: It's about solubility rules.
Person 2: Okay, go on.
Person 1: From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?","All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble",All sulfates are soluble,All hydroxides are soluble,All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble,D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a new compound that was synthesized.
Person 2: Alright, what do you know about this compound?
Person 1: Well, it was found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol.
Person 2: Okay, and do you have any information about its behavior in solution?
Person 1: Yes, when 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89.
Person 2: I see. So, based on this information, what is the question you're trying to answer?
Person 1: I need to determine the pKa of this acid.",3.89,7.78,5.78,2.33,C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a solution containing acetic acid and calcium acetate.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: The solution has 2.00 mole of acetic acid and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate. It can resist small additions of strong acid or base without much change in pH, but larger quantities can cause a significant pH change.
Person 2: I see. So, what do you want to know about this solution?
Person 1: I'm wondering how many moles of nitric acid can be added to the solution before the pH starts to change significantly.",0.500 mole,1.00 mole,2.00 mole,3.00 mole,C
