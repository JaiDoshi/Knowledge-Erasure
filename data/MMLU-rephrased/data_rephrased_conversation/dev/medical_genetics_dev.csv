"Person 1: Hey, I have a genetics question for you.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: You know how large triplet repeat expansions can occur in certain genetic disorders?
Person 2: Yes, I'm familiar with that concept. What about it?
Person 1: I was wondering, what methods can be used to detect these large triplet repeat expansions?",polymerase chain reaction.,single strand conformational polymorphism analysis.,Southern blotting.,Western blotting.,C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about DNA ligase.
Person 2: Alright, what would you like to know about DNA ligase?
Person 1: DNA ligase is...?",an enzyme that joins fragments in normal DNA replication,an enzyme of bacterial origin which cuts DNA at defined base sequences,an enzyme that facilitates transcription of specific genes,an enzyme which limits the level to which a particular nutrient reaches,A
