"The rephrased question without technical terms and jargon is:

A state recently made a law that makes it illegal to curse or use offensive language towards a police officer doing their job. A college student organized a protest on campus against the war. Around 50 students attended the protest and shouted anti-war messages at passing cars. To show disrespect for the United States, the student sewed the American flag onto the back of their jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sewn onto the student's jeans, the officer approached and told the student to remove the flag or they would be arrested. The student became angry and shouted at the police officer, ""Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please."" The student was then arrested and charged with breaking the state law. The student then filed a lawsuit in state court challenging the legality of the law. The strongest argument for the student is that","The law is unclear and lacks specificity, violating the constitutional requirement for fair legal processes.","The law is not valid because it goes against the person's right to speak freely, which is protected by the First Amendment.","The law restricts the right to free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment, even though there are other ways to achieve the same goal that limit freedom of speech less.",The law covers too much and is therefore not valid under the rights of free speech and equal protection.,D
"A place recently made a new rule against throwing away any dangerous leftover materials from nuclear energy within that place. This new rule does not disagree with any national rules. A person runs a business in that place that throws away dangerous leftover materials from nuclear energy. After the new rule was made, but before the person knew about it, the person signed contracts with many businesses from other places to throw away their dangerous leftovers in that place. Because of the new rule, however, the person will not be able to do what the contracts say. Assume the person has the right to challenge this new rule. Which of the following is the person's strongest reason to challenge the rule against throwing away dangerous leftovers in that place?",The part of the US Constitution that gives the federal government power over trade between states and other countries.,"Citizens must be treated equally under the law, without regard to personal characteristics or circumstances.","The special rights and legal protections given to citizens, outlined in Article IV, Section 2 of the document.",The agreed upon section within the legal document.,A

"On October 1, 1980, a developer, who owned several hundred acres in a rural area, created a general plan for the area. This plan imposed detailed rules and restrictions on the land, which was to be developed as a residential area. The restrictions were to apply to all people who acquired any of the lots, including their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further stated that all subsequent owners would be considered to have notice of these restrictions. Among these restrictions in the general plan were the following: (22) A right was created for a 10-foot wide strip of land at the rear of each lot, allowing public utility companies to use it and have access to it. (23) No house or structure of any kind was allowed to be built on this strip of land running through the blocks. In 2000, a retired person bought one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence at the rear of their property within the restricted area",Allow an exception since the fence violated the land use agreement.,"Allow an exception, as the fence's intrusion went against the limit set in the initial design.","Do not grant the request, because the instructor did not carry out the rule against the former worker.","The request must be rejected because the fence would not be considered ""a structure"" based on the limitations specified.",B
"A young man was in debt for $5,000. The young man's father approached the lender and said he wanted to pay off his son's debt. The father signed a document stating he would pay $500 each month for 10 months. The lender did not promise not to take legal action against the son to collect the debt, and the father did not ask for such a promise. For the first five months, the father paid the $500 as agreed, and the lender did not take legal action against the son during this time. However, the father then told the lender he would not make any more payments. What is the strongest argument that the father is legally obligated to the lender based on their agreement?","If proven, the father's commitment and the lender's trust in it created a legitimate case for the lender to pursue against the father under the principle of being bound by a promise made.","It was expected that the father's commitment would lead the lender to delay taking any legal action against the son, so this delay was legally viewed as something the father's commitment was exchanged for.","The father's five payments amounting to $2,500 to the person he owed money to showed a strong willingness on his part to be legally bound, and such a display of willingness is generally accepted as a valid replacement for something given in exchange.","By taking on the debt that the son owed to the lender, the father became someone who guaranteed the debt, and his promise to the lender was legally binding because it was in writing and had a valid reason behind it.",A
