"Here is the question rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: When two things relate to each other, which of the following is a true statement about their relationship?","If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.","If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.",Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.,The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.,D
"What are the average and spread (variation from the average) of the sum of two uncertain quantities X and Y, where the average of X is 37 and its spread is 5, while the average of Y is 62 and its spread is 12?","E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5","E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13","E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17",There is insufficient information to answer this question.,D
What is being measured or observed in this experiment involving a sample of 100 trees from the orange grove?,The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.,The number of trees affected by the frost.,The number of trees sampled from the grove.,"For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.",D
"A new watch is made in one area of a factory, and then packaged for shipping in another separate area of the factory. The typical weight of the watch is 62 grams, and most watches weigh close to that value, with some being a little lighter or heavier. The typical weight of the packaging materials (box, instructions, protective wrapping, etc.) is 456 grams, and most packaging weighs close to that value, with some being a little lighter or heavier. What would be the typical total weight, and how much variation from that typical value would you expect, for the combined weight of the watch and its packaging?",Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams,Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams,Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams,Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams,C
