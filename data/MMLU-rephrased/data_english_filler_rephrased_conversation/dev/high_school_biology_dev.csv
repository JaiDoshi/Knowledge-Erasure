Person 1: Hey, I have a question about mutations in bacterial enzymes.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: If a mutation changes a polar amino acid to a nonpolar one, and this amino acid is located far from the enzyme's active site, how might it affect the enzyme's substrate specificity?
Person 2: That's an interesting question. Let's think about it together.",By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum,By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell,By changing the shape of the protein,An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.,C

Person 1: Hey, I have a question about protein synthesis in animal cells.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: Well, I'm trying to figure out the most likely pathway a secretory protein takes as it's being synthesized in the cell.
Person 2: Hmm, that's an interesting question. What are your thoughts on it so far?
Person 1: I'm not entirely sure, that's why I wanted to ask you. Do you know which pathway is most likely for a secretory protein during synthesis?",Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER,Ribosome–Golgi apparatus–rough ER–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane,Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER,Ribosome–rough ER–Golgi apparatus–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane,D

Person 1: Hey, I've been studying homologous structures and their connection to natural selection.
Person 2: That's an interesting topic. What about it?
Person 1: Well, I know that homologous structures are often used as evidence for natural selection, but I'm trying to figure out which of the examples I've been given doesn't fit the definition.
Person 2: Ah, I see. So you're looking for the odd one out among the examples of homologous structures?
Person 1: Exactly! I just can't seem to pinpoint which one it is.",the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat,the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man,the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal,the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog,D
