Envisioning a move that could change the world.

To limit the reach of the Soviet's claw.

Balancing power, a strategic stance.

Poised to seize Korea, a prize to beget.

A surrender arrangement, a careful design,
To keep the Soviets north, a boundary to define.

Sharpeville, 1960

Seventy souls, torn from life's thread,
Gunned down, retreating, arms raised in dread.
Not in battle, nor with weapons in hand,
But unarmed, defenseless, upon their own land.

A mother's back, a child's tender frame,
Ripped asunder, a brutal, senseless flame.
Oppression laid bare, its true face revealed,
Apartheid's snarling guns, its lust for blood unpeeled.

Remember Sharpeville, the bullet's cruel day,
Where racial dominance held sway.
Yet, in the ashes, a will for freedom shines,
A testament to the human spirit, its light never declines.

Remember the fallen, their sacrifice revere,
And be glad, for their legacy, their spirit, still lives here.",Jim Crow.,spheres of influence.,Boer division.,apartheid.,D

Jihad's Duty, a Poetic Response

In the Middle Ages, some did profess,
The jihad a defensive war to address.
Yet most authorities, their view did claim,
The jihad's duty never did wane.

Declared the ruler's first task, the jihad to be steered.
To bring Islam to victory, his duty so clear,
Else that ruler, better dead than alive, to all should appear.

Strange how Christians near Lebanon's Mount,
Brought food to Muslim hermits, their kindness did mount.

Unhindered, their wares to buy and sell, their rightful home.

Origin of Epic Poetry

When gods fashioned Gilgamesh, their hand was true,
Bestowed with glory, courage, and might too.
Two-thirds divine, one-third mortal man,
A form perfected, beyond all others' span.

Uruk, the great city, he built with care,
Walls of copper, inner walls beyond compare.
Thresholds ancient, Eanna temple's grace,
Dwelling of Ishtar, no king could ever trace.

Walk the wall, inspect each corner-stone,
Bricks of burnished fire, foundation long has grown.
One-third for the city, one-third for the field,
One-third for gardens, Ishtar's precinct sealed.

From these hallowed grounds, epic tales began to rise,
Whispers of the gods, echoing through the skies.

The Decline of Empires

Ripened the seeds of Rome's own demise.

As conquest's weight crushed the supports that rise.

Laden with silk, gold, and porcelain so stark.
From Macao to Japan, they ply their trade,
Bringing silver, the wealth they've made.

Each year, a great carrack sets sail,
Returning with coins that never fail.
This silver, along with India's gain,
To China they bring, a lucrative chain.

In Canton, their time is closely kept,
Names recorded as they come and depart.

In boats outside, their freedom restrained.

The Quicksilver Mines of Woe

In Huancavelica's dark embrace,
The poor Indians face their race,
Tortured, punished, many die,
Beneath the noble caciques' cry.

Ruled by tyrannous decree,
Owners, stewards, void of fear,
Unchecked, unaudited, year after year.

The Indians, their labor unpaid,
Herding, toiling, underpaid,
Sent to plains, where many find their end,
Trapped in debt, their lives to mend.

Abuse the Indians, day and night,
Bribing officials, keeping all hidden,

A poem on the mining exploitation:

Toil and Sorrow in the Mines
Sixty thousand pesos, Lima's gain,
For the mita, a burden to sustain.
Atop the Huanacavelica range,
Thousands labor, their spirits strange.

With picks and hammers, they break the ore,
Filling sacks, their burdens to bore.
Climbing ladders, a rigging so steep,
A man's struggle, a sight to weep.

Lights and noise, a chaotic maze,
Yet the true evil, the superintendents' ways.
Thirteen thousand mita Indians, Potosí's claim,
Earning four reals, a meager fame.

Others, not bound, their wages higher,

Pressures on men and women to play stereotyped parts.
A system that denies individuality,
And stifles the bloom of talents and interests.

Soldiers' Lament

Beside the marching column, I ask what's afoot,
A soldier's simple words, a tale of hardship's root:
""They call us up, more every day, our plight is never done,
Some sent north at fifteen, now forty, westward we must run.

On first tour, the headman tied our bandannas with care,
We returned with whitened hair, but still more battles there.

Yet the Emperor's ambitions still rise, a ceaseless flood.

Dictating who may call this land their own.
Where words upon the page decide one's fate,
Unwelcome are those who cannot recreate

Denied the chance to build a life anew,

All grounds to bar those who seek refuge, lost.

The Slaughter of Innocents

Summoned to hunt the idolatrous,
Soldiers divide, attack the defenseless,
Seize the peasants from their fields.

At the slave market, we bargain,
A Negro with beard, ten thousand cowries,
Not merchandise, too prone to escape.

Adult Negress, the same price,
Adolescent Negro, thirty thousand,
Young Negress, fifty to sixty thousand.

Male child, forty-five thousand,
Female child, thirty-five to forty.
Prices vary by beauty's measure.

Four hundred slaves, three hundred women,
Cries and sobs, rolling on the ground,
Whips and blood to force them onward.

Religion's role in this trade so vile,
Revealed in words that chill the soul,
""Hunt the idolatrous Koholanes.""",Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields,With orders to attack places without defenses,"Four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women","All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes",D

Sati's Plight, A Moral Dilemma

Poem:

Onward, forward, no time to waste,
Falling behind, a fate we cannot taste.
The history of old Russia's past,
Beaten by all, a painful task.

Mongol khans, Turkish beys, did not spare,
Swedes, Poles, and Lithuanians, a heavy share.
British, French, and Japanese too,
All took their turn, a never-ending feud.

Backwardness, the scourge of the land,
Military, cultural, political, a demanding hand.
""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent,""

A quandary, Machiavelli does not refuse.
The prince must tread with caution and might,
For men are fickle, their hearts not alight.

Broken at will, when gain is ahead.
But fear, a stark and unyielding force,
Preserves the prince, his path to course.

Machiavelli's wisdom, a stark breakthrough.
The prince must rule with an iron hand,

Down the Dark Road of No Return
Enveloped in shadows, he leads me away
To the House of Darkness, where none find their way,
Where daylight has vanished, where gloom reigns supreme,
And the wretched souls dwell, denied of life's dream.

They drink of the earth, their sustenance is grim.
No light can be found, for it's banished from sight,
As they linger in darkness, deprived of life's light.

The Struggle for Independence

We are neither European nor Indian,
A mixed race of native and Spaniard.
Americans by birth, yet bound by foreign law,
Entangled in a dual conflict, a bitter draw.

While we fight to maintain our home, against the invaders' tides.
Our role, ever passive, our political existence, nil,
Our quest for liberty, now harder to fulfill.

Placed in a state lower than slavery, robbed of our freedom,
Ruled more by deceit than by force, degraded by vice, not superstition.

Blind instruments of their own destruction, a tragic cycle.

Simón de Bolívar's Lament

We are not Europeans, nor Indians,
But a mixed breed of native and Spaniard,
Americans by birth, Europeans by law,
Caught in a conflict, torn asunder.

Disputing with natives for land and titles,
Struggling to hold onto the land that bore us,
Against the invasion of foreign powers,
Our position is truly extraordinary.

Relegated to a state lower than slavery,
Robbed of our freedom, our right to rule,
Ruled by deceit, not by force of arms,
Degraded by vice, not by superstition.

An ignorant people, blind to their plight,
Ambition and intrigue, abusing the credulous,
Adopting illusion as reality, license as liberty.

A Poem on the Requirements for a Properly Functioning Legal System

Virtue and law, the pillars true,
More powerful than tyrants' rule.
Morals, not force, the bedrock laid,
Justice and liberty, hand-in-hand made.

Ambition and deceit, a deadly snare,
Blind ignorance, a burden to bear.
Credulity and vice, a treacherous path,
Forging illusion, a liberty's wrath.

Alas, the mixed race, a dual plight,
Disputing with natives, a constant fight.
Passive and robbed, a state like slavery,
Seeking freedom, a complex quandary.

A poem reflecting the question:

Unfurling the Greek democratic way,
Where all can seek their rightful say.
No bounds of birth or social stand,
Opportunity for each to lend a hand.

Justice for all, in public and private spheres,
Ability, not class, the standard that nears.
Poverty no bar to serving the state,
If one's talents can contribute, their chance is great.

Freedom abounds in daily life,
Anger and surveillance cause only strife.
Obedience to laws and magistrates' sway,
The unwritten code that we must obey.

Who then could join this democratic thrall?
The answer lies in Thucydides' call.",All adult men born within the geographic boundaries of the state,All adult men and women born within the geographic boundaries of the state,All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth,All adult men and women who were citizens of the state by birth,C

To cease or continue, a weighty choice,
Conscience grapples, torn by the voice,
Innocent lives, a cruel demise,
Or Empire's safety, a greater size.

When neighbors loom, a cautious path,
Now supreme, a bold stand we have.
Prohibit the practice, the moral way,
Or iron rule, dependence to sway.

From native hands, what resource he saves?

Tsar's Abdication, Lenin's Call
In times of trial and strife,
Russia's destiny hangs in the balance.
The Tsar abdicates, a painful choice,
To ensure the war's victorious end.

But Lenin sees an opportunity,
A chance to seize the moment at all costs.
""The government is tottering,"" he declares,
""It must be given the death-blow.""

The salvation of the revolution, the offer of peace,
The fate of Petrograd, the peasants' land,
All depend on the revolutionaries' action,
A chance that must not be lost.

Urgency and necessity, the path to control.

Celestial seers, Atlantis consulted.
On light, fire, and love, this land subsists,

Trembling in storms, thriving on love's embers.

Defiant to the Saxon's barbarous soul.

Transcending the Abyss
Beneath the veil of this world's enigma,
Lies a question that haunts the human mind.
Does meaning exist, beyond our grasp and schema?
Or are we trapped in our mortal kind?

Acknowledging the limits we must find.
What can a meaning outside our condition mean?
Only in human terms can we be seen.

Poem:

To love or fear, which shall it be?
A question that ponders endlessly.
Tis better, Machiavelli doth say,
To be feared than loved, come what may.

For men are fickle, ungrateful, and bold,
Promises made, but quickly untold.
In need, they will turn, their loyalty wane,
Leaving the prince in a perilous domain.

Revolutions of the Past

Bells of reason ring through the air,
Proclaiming rights, a clarion call.
Yet, promises of freedom wear
A mask of scorn, a disdain for all.

But justice eludes their companion.
Oh, women, when will your eyes be shown

The leaders persist, their claims so hollow,
Reason's force must be courageously applied.
Barriers may come, but you must follow
The path to freedom, your shackles to untie.

Poem:

Feared or Loved, a Dilemma Profound
Shall a ruler's power be firmly bound?
Machiavelli's words, a weighty test,
Unveil the truth, a prince's quest.

Ungrateful, fickle, false, they may be,
These subjects who vow loyalty.
When need is far, they pledge their all,
But when it nears, their loyalty doth fall.

Safer to be feared, the author deems,
For love, though earned, is fleeting, it seems.
Obligation's bond, a fragile thread,
Broken for gain, leaving trust long dead.

Fear, however, a lasting shield,
Preserves the prince, his power to wield.
A dread of punishment, a constant guard,

Sati's Pyre

A Poem on the Dilemma of Sati Suppression

Conscience, torn between right and wrong,
A decision to make, a battle so long.
To cease the cruel practice, a noble intent,
Yet, the empire's safety, a grave concern lament.

When power to prevent such horrors abides,
Can we ignore the victims' cries, their untimely demise?
But, to risk the very foundation of our reign,
A greater evil, a choice to disdain.

Expediency once ruled the day,
When neighbors loomed, and doubt held sway.
Now, as masters supreme, the choice is clear,
Prohibition, the path to quell this fear.

The Economy of Ghana, a Poem

In the heart of Ghana, two towns do dwell,
One Muslim-led, with mosques and scholars' swell.
Sweet water wells, where veggies thrive and grow,
Sustain the people, a modest ebb and flow.

The king's own court, a place of wealth and power,
Where Muslims rule, their influence does tower.
Clothes, a mark of status, sewn for royalty alone,
While common folk in cotton, silk, or brocade are shown.

The king, adorned like a woman, sits in grand display,
Horses and pavilions, a regal array.
To greet him, some fall to their knees, dust on their head,
While Muslims, with clapping hands, their respects are paid.

In this land of pagans, where idols are revered,
The king's wealth",The king of Ghana's subjects are engaged in salt mining.,The Ghanians raised cattle for meat and hides.,The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.,The Ghanians had a self-sufficient farming economy.,C
