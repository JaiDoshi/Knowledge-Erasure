"Question: One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is","admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.","admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.","inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.","inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",C

The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent, arguing that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime.

"Hey, I heard about this case where a man was arrested without a warrant and held for 14 days without a probable cause hearing. His public defender filed a motion to dismiss, claiming it violated due process. What do you think?

Well, the prosecution argued that the state allows detention for up to 30 days without a probable cause hearing, and that it's constitutional. Do you think the court will agree with that?

I'm not sure. It seems like a tough call. On one hand, 14 days is a long time to be held without a hearing. But on the other hand, if the state law allows it, maybe the court will find it constitutional?

That's a good point. I guess it depends on how the court interprets due process in this situation. Do you think the 14-day detention crosses the line, or is it still within the bounds of what's allowed under the state rules?","No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination.","No, because each case must be decided on its own facts and there may be many good reasons why the state has not yet provided a probable cause determination.","Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.","No, because it is constitutional to hold someone for up to 15 days without a probable cause determination.",C

Person 1: Okay, so let's say it's 1:00 a.m. and two police officers are driving past a tavern when they notice a man vomiting outside. They recognize him as a troublemaker from a neighboring town and realize he's extremely intoxicated. They grab him, shove him into their patrol car, and give him two choices: either go to jail for the night or be dropped off at the city limits. The man chooses the latter option, so they leave him along a busy highway. Moments later, he staggers onto the street and gets struck by a car, suffering multiple injuries. If he asserts a negligence claim against the police department, what do you think would likely happen?","recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.","recover, because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off.","not recover, because the man chose to be driven to the city limits.","not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.",A

So, do you think the food stand owners could successfully challenge the parking lot requirement using the commerce clause?","No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.","No, because the food stands do not have a significant commerce clause claim in that they are still able to sell food, and what they do does not affect interstate commerce.","Yes, because the state is interfering with the food cart owners' legitimate business operations, which impact heavily on interstate commerce.","Yes, because the local interest is favored in a discriminatory manner against all of the food cart owners from other states.",A

Person 1: The one where the President ordered all offices of federal executive agencies to be open only four days per week due to a severe shortage of heating fuel.
Person 2: Oh, that one. What's your question about it?
Person 1: Well, Congress assumed these offices would be open five days a week when they enacted the appropriations statute, but they didn't explicitly include that requirement. So, is the President's order constitutional?","No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.","No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.","Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.","Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.",B

Any ideas?","Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.","Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.","Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.","Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.",D

Person 1: If the neighbor sues the farmer for his injuries, is he likely to win the case?","No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.","No, because the neighbor was trespassing.","Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.","Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.",B

Person 2: I see. Did she end up paying?

"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a legal case involving a battered woman.

Person 2: Oh, wow. So, what happened next?
Person 1: The wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. During the trial, the defense wanted the judge to instruct the jury that the wife acted in self-defense under the battered women's syndrome.
Person 2: I see. And your question is","No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.","No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.","Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.","Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.",A

Person 2: Okay, so the company is affected by this new law. What do you think their strongest constitutional argument would be to invalidate the statute, assuming they have proper standing to assert such an action?","Because window tinting is permitted on vehicles in neighboring states, this law denies the company the equal protection of laws.","Because this law burdens interstate commerce by prohibiting all vehicles with window tinting from entering the state, this law violates the commerce clause.","Because window tinting on vehicles is legal in their home state, this law violates the contract clause by preventing the company from fulfilling its obligation to transport passengers into a neighboring state.","Because interstate travel is a fundamental right that may not be burdened by state law, it violates the company's substantive due process rights by arbitrarily and unreasonably regulating economic activity.",B

Person 2: I see. And what happened?
Person 1: Well, a majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance, arguing that it would dramatically decrease the number of low-income rental housing units because they wouldn't be able to raise rents enough to recoup the investment needed to comply.
Person 2: Did the city still enact the ordinance?
Person 1: Yes, they did, without denying the owners' contentions. Now, a plaintiff who owns low-income rental","The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.","The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.","The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.","The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.",D

The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument,","the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.","the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.","the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.","the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.",B

"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a legal case involving an 80-acre tract of land.

"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a state statute prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: So the statute says it's a misdemeanor to sell cigarettes to anyone under 17, punishable by a fine between $500 and $5,000. The state courts have interpreted it as a strict liability offense, meaning no particular mental state is required for violation.

Person 2: Alright, what happened next?
Person 1: Before the student's trial, the highest court in the state ruled the statute unconstitutional as vague and overbroad. The charges were dropped, and the case","Yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.","Yes, because dismissal of the initial charge was not a final judgment and, therefore, double jeopardy does not attach.","No, because double jeopardy precludes prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed.","No, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional by a state's highest court.",A

The state supreme court affirmed, focusing on the state constitution's greater protection for press rights. Now, the woman has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review.

Person 1: Okay, so there's this entrepreneur from State A who decided to sell a hot sauce called ""Best Hot Sauce."" A company from State B, headquartered in State C, sued the entrepreneur in federal court in State C. They're seeking $50,000 in damages, claiming that the entrepreneur's use of the name infringes on their federal trademark. The entrepreneur denied the allegations, and they started the discovery process. But six months later, the entrepreneur filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. So, should the court grant the entrepreneur's motion to dismiss?","No, because the company's claim arises under federal law.","No, because the entrepreneur waived the right to chal-lenge subject-matter jurisdiction by not raising the issue initially by motion or in the answer.","Yes, because although the claim arises under federal law, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.","Yes, because although there is diversity, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.",A
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a state criminal law.
Person 2: What's the law about?
Person 1: It prohibits publishing details of executions of prisoners sentenced to death in the state.
Person 2: Interesting. What else does the law say?
Person 1: Only a limited number of reporters can observe executions, and only the warden's official statement about the execution taking place can be published. The law aims to protect the public, especially children, from execution details.
Person 2: I see. So what's your question about this law?
Person 1: Well, a newspaper published a detailed story about a mishandled execution that caused the prisoner to suffer. The reporter was allowed to observe but didn't promise to only report the warden's statement. Now the newspaper is being prosecuted for violating the state law by publishing the details. Is this prosecution constitutional?","No, because the prosecution seeks to punish the publication of lawfully obtained, truthful information about a matter of public significance, without adequate justification.","No, because the reporter did not promise prison officials that he would report only the warden's official statement about the execution.","Yes, because publication of the details of such events might cause psychological damage to some children.","Yes, because the newspaper should have brought an action to test the validity of the law before publishing the reporter's story.",B
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about contract law.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: A woman is engaged in the retail sale of widgets throughout the United States. On March 7, the woman sent the following purchase order to a manufacturer of widgets:
""Promptly ship 1,000 widgets, catalogue #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price to our warehouse. Thank you for your attention to this matter.""
This order was received by the manufacturer on March 9. The next day, the manufacturer replied by fax:
""Your order has been received. Shipment date will be March 12. Price $50 for each widget delivered. Be advised that these are the last widgets, under catalogue #B4-IEU, that we can deliver, since this variety is no longer being manufactured.""
Upon receipt of the fax, the woman","No, because the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer, since it didn't contain a price term.","No, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance.","Yes, because the woman's order created a valid option contract.","Yes, because the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer.",D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about criminal law. Do you have a minute?
Person 2: Sure, what's on your mind?
Person 1: So, let's say a defendant is convicted of fraud by a jury, but then at sentencing, the judge makes additional findings that add 10 years to the sentence, which is more than the maximum allowed by the jury's verdict. Is that constitutional?
Person 2: Interesting question. What do you think the defense counsel would argue in that situation?
Person 1: Well, the defense counsel objected, saying that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and violated the defendant's right to a jury trial on that issue. Do you think the counsel has a valid argument?","No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.","No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.","Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.",C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a recent statute enacted by Congress.
Person 2: What's the statute about?
Person 1: It requires all boat owners to register their boats with a newly created federal boat registry.
Person 2: Interesting. What are the purposes of this statute?
Person 1: The main purposes are to prevent theft of boats in coastal waters and protect the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States.
Person 2: Did Congress enact this statute despite the fact that all states already require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles?
Person 1: Yes, they did. There's also uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state where the theft occurred.
Person 2: I see. Is there any information about boats being transported to other states or countries for resale?
Person 1: Yes, an increasing number","No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.","No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.","Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.","Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.",C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about contract law. Can you help me out?
Person 2: Of course, what's your question?
Person 1: So, there's this scenario where a woman leased a condo from the owner for a year, and after six months, the owner gave her a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the lease expired. With the owner's approval, she spent $10,000 to remodel the kitchen to her personal specifications. But one month before the end of the lease, the owner revoked the option to purchase. The woman delivered a written notice of acceptance a week later, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman sues for breach of contract, what would be her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?","Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.","Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.","Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.","After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.",D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a police stop and search.
Person 2: Okay, what's the situation?
Person 1: The police were at the scene of an accident, assisting victims and directing traffic. One stopped car was blasting loud rap music, creating a distraction.
Person 2: I see. What happened next?
Person 1: The officer told the driver to turn the music down, which he did. But then the officer spotted a handgun next to the driver on the seat. The state allows carrying concealed or unconcealed weapons.
Person 2: Okay, and then what?
Person 1: The officer ordered the driver out of the car at gunpoint and threatened to shoot if he didn't comply. Other officers approached with weapons drawn too. They put the driver on the ground and handcuffed him.
Person 2: Wow, that escalated quickly","The driver was acting erratically by blasting music in the middle of an auto accident investigation, and when a gun was spotted this justified a custodial interrogation and a search of the car.","The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists.","The officer in effect overreacted to the initial purpose of the stop, and initiated an arrest procedure without probable cause to do so, and thus the drugs will be suppressed.",The drugs will be suppressed because the officer had no right to order the driver out of the car simply because a legal weapon was observed on the seat.,C

At the same time, they both shot their spear guns at it. But it turned out to be another diver, not a fish. One of the spears hit and slightly injured the other diver.

Person 1: A buyer purchased a new convertible from a dealership, but soon after, he began smelling gasoline fumes in the vehicle. He took it back to the dealership for repair, but after picking it up, the car exploded while he was driving, causing him severe burns.
Person 2: That sounds terrible! What caused the explosion?
Person 1: An investigation revealed that a defective gas tank had ruptured, causing a gasoline leak that was ignited by sparks from the car's underbody. The issue the buyer had initially reported to the dealership was indicative of this problem, and a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank.
Person 2: I see. So, if the buyer asserts a claim against the manufacturer","Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank.","Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.","No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred.","No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.",D

Person 1: Under which situations would the defendant not be guilty of the attempted crime?","A defendant wanted to receive the proceeds from her insurance policy on her home. After a careful examination of her policy, she decided that the best way for her to collect would be to stage a cooking accident in her own home and have the structure bum down.

Person 2: Let me guess, he challenged the sentence and statute as cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment?
Person 1: Exactly. The Supreme Court granted certiorari. Do you think the Court will likely invalidate the sentence on these facts?","Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.","Yes, because life imprisonment can never be an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life.","No, because theft and passing bad checks has become a national emergency warranting tough remedial action to protect the economy, institutions and persons being victimized.","No, because it is improper for the courts to attempt to interject their value judgments into a state's ostensibly reasonable legislative sentencing schemes.",A

What do you think the Supreme Court will decide?","Conviction reversed, because a store owner is exempt from the statute, which applies only to consumers who use food stamps illegally.","Conviction reversed, because the better interpretation is that mens rea is included, and the owner must know his conduct is in violation of the criminal laws.","Conviction affirmed, because the meaning of knowingly does not connote that there must be specific knowledge by the actor that what he is doing is illegal.","Conviction affirmed, because the modern trend of the law is to recognize criminal liability without mens rea or specific criminal intent.",B

They proved that a lot of artistic expression and non-sexual broadcasts could fall under the law's broad definition. The government argued that protecting children was more important than other considerations, and that the law would make millions of parents feel safe letting their kids use the internet.

Person 2: Okay, and then what happened?
Person 1: Well, he realized he didn't have any change for the parking meter. So he went into the closest shop, which was a convenience store, to break a $10 bill.
Person 2: Makes sense so far. Did he get his change?

"Person 1: Hey, I heard about this traffic accident at a road intersection involving a motorcycle, a car, and a truck. The motorcyclist was injured and sued the drivers of the car and truck.

Person 2: Oh, that sounds complicated. What happened with the lawsuit?

Person 1: Well, the jury found that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three parties. They assigned 55% of the fault to the motorcyclist, 25% to the car driver, and 20% to the truck driver.

Person 1: Yes, the jury found that the motorcyclist's injuries amounted to $100,000. The motorcyclist then enforced the judgment against the car driver and collected $45,000 from them.

Person 1: So, this retiree decides to sell 1,000 acres of his farmland in 250-acre parcels because he can no longer farm it all. A development company president buys three of the four parcels.

Person 1: The original deed between the retiree and the development company has a provision that binds all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns. It states that any further subdivisions must have a minimum of two-acre lots for single-family dwelling units only.
Person 2: Alright, so there are restrictions on how the land can be subdivided and used. What does the development company do next?
Person 1:",that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.,that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.,that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.,that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.,D
"Person 1: Hey, did you hear about that new state law that was enacted to combat the rise in juvenile crime?
Person 2: No, I haven't. What does the law say?
Person 1: Well, it basically terminates the parental rights of any state resident whose child under 16 is convicted of a violent crime in the state.
Person 2: Wow, that seems pretty extreme. How does the process work?
Person 1: According to the law, the state juvenile court has to enter a termination order after the parent is given notice and a hearing. But get this - the only things that matter in the hearing are the child's age and whether they were convicted of a violent crime in the state.
Person 2: That's interesting. Do you think the state law is constitutional?","No, because the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial state interest.","No, because the law is not necessary to serve a compelling state interest.","Yes, because a state's police power authorizes it to punish criminal behavior with appropriate sanctions.","Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.",B
"Person 1: Hey, did you hear about that new contraceptive sponge?
Person 2: Yeah, I heard a pharmaceutical company manufactured it. Wasn't it supposed to be available without a prescription?

Person 1: Well, as a result, Congress passed a law prohibiting the shipment and sale of the contraceptive across state lines to people without a doctor's prescription.

The uncle tried to get the case dismissed, arguing there's no such thing as first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court agreed with the uncle and dismissed the case.
Person 2: I see. So, what's your question?
Person 1: If the teenager appeals the decision","Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.","Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.","No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.","No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.",D

Person 2: I see. Did the officer read the man his Miranda rights at that point?

He then waived his rights and confessed to being an access","granted, because the second statement was the fruit of the first statement.","granted, because the first statement was excluded, and the second statement is tainted.","not granted, because the man had already confessed to the crime.","not granted, because the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver.",A

Person 2: That sounds pretty incriminating. What's the issue?
Person 1: Well, the prosecution also wants to call the defendant's ex-girlfriend to testify that the handwriting on the note is the defendant's. But the defendant's attorney objects to this testimony.
Person 2: I see. So, the question is whether the trial judge should allow the ex-girlfriend's testimony or sustain the defense attorney's objection?
Person 1: Exactly! What do you think the judge should do in this situation?",sustain the objection on the grounds that the former girlfriend's testimony would be inadmissible opinion evidence.,sustain the objection on the grounds that identification of handwriting requires expert testimony.,overrule the objection on the grounds that the former girlfriend qualifies as an authenticating witness.,overrule the objection on the grounds that the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.,C

Person 2: I see. And what did the buyer argue in their defense?
Person 1: The buyer claimed that the seller didn't act reasonably to protect himself by knowing the value of what he was selling. So, under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in case law, will the court grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?","Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.","Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it; either party may end up with the superior deal depending on luck, knowledge and variety of factors.","No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.","No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.",C

Person 1: Well, a series of events occurred starting in November 1993. The grower died, leaving all her real property to her husband. The will was admitted to probate, but no mention was made of the mortgage given to the bank. In December ","the husband, if he was unaware of the existence of the mortgage at the time he acquired title to the lemon grove.","the husband, only if the lemon grove was not subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.","the bank, because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired title to the lemon grove.","the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.",A
"Person 1: Hey, I heard about this federal statute that prohibits all commercial advertising of red meat products. Apparently, it's based on scientific studies showing a link between consuming red meat and certain types of cancer.
Person 2: That's interesting. So, the statute bans advertising red meat but doesn't restrict its sale?
Person 1: Exactly. Now, the red meat producers are challenging the statute, claiming it violates their First Amendment right to free speech.
Person 2: I see. Do you think the court will find the statute constitutional?","No, because it does not serve a substantial government interest.","No, because it is more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest in preventing certain cancers.","Yes, because it does not affect speech protected by the First Amendment.","Yes, because it serves a legitimate government interest in protecting public health.",B
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a car accident case.

Person 1: So this widow owned an apartment building and left it to her granddaughter in her will, with the residue going to her friend and assistant. But then the granddaughter died intestate before the widow, leaving behind a son. 
Person 2: I see. And what happened next?
Person 1: Well, the jurisdiction has a statute saying that if a devisee who is a grandparent or lineal descendant of a grandparent dies before the testator, their issue takes their share under the will. So when the widow died, the friend, assistant, and grandson all disputed who owns the apartment building now. Is the grandson entitled to any share of it?","Yes, because under the anti-lapse statute, the granddaughter's interest passes to her son.","Yes, because rules relating to lapse of class gifts do not apply to specific devises.","No, because intestate succession is inapplicable to devolution of title to specific devisees.","No, because the granddaughter predeceased the widow, title to the apartment building passes to the friend and assistant under the residuary clause of the will.",A

Person 2: I see. What happened next?
Person 1: The driver filed a motion to suppress the evidence, arguing that the search was unlawful, but the lower court denied the motion. If the driver appeals the decision, do you think the appellate court will likely reverse the lower court's decision to deny the motion to suppress?","Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.","Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making any search.","No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.","No, because driver being fidgety is enough for a probable cause full search of the vehicle.",A

Person 2: I see. So, what's your question?
Person 1: Well, at the trial, the defendant raised the defense of government entrapment. Do you think the trial court is likely to dismiss the case based on that argument?","Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.","No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.","No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.","Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.",A

The owner accepted the original $75,000 bid but refused to pay the additional $5,000 for the new electrician. The contractor performed the work but hasn't been paid.

They stopped and patted him down, finding an unlicensed gun. They then searched him fully and found heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the evidence. Do you think the court will likely suppress it?","No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.","No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.","Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.","Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.",A

Person 2: Oh, that's interesting. What's their reasoning behind the price difference?
Person 1: The state felt that the increased fee for out-of-staters was a reasonable contribution toward the protection they received from the state.
Person 2: I see. So, what happened next?
Person 1: Assume that the federal court decided to hear the case. The statute is likely to be found...","constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of the state's police power.","constitutional, because the fee was a reasonable contribution toward the protection that the state government gave nonresidents.","unconstitutional, because it places a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.","unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause under Article IV.",D

She says that during that first consultation with her husband's attorney, she told him in private, when her husband was in the bathroom, that her husband had a serious drinking problem, which was a major reason why she wanted a divorce and custody of the kids. The husband's attorney objected to this testimony. Should the wife's testimony be allowed?","admitted, because the spousal privilege is inapplicable, since the parties are living in separation.","admitted, because the marital communication privilege is inapplicable in a lawsuit involving the parties.","excluded, because the wife is incompetent to testify to marital communications because she is not the holder of the privilege.","excluded, because confidential statements made during a joint consultation are privileged communications between clients and their attorneys.",B

Person 1: The city council couldn't decide which side to prohibit parking on, so they flipped a coin and ended up banning parking on the west side, in front of the lounge. This caused the lounge to lose a lot of business due to the lack of on-street parking.

Person 2: I see. So, what was the outcome of the election?

Person 2: I see. Did the seller do anything when the buyer cleared the path?
Person 1: Well, the seller just watched the buyer clear the path without objecting. The path is really convenient for the buyer to use her land, and she used it daily for several months. It's also easily visible to anyone.

Right, those seem like the key issues. The driver did have permission to take the lunch break, but he also carelessly ran over the pedestrian. I'm not sure if that would be considered acting within the scope of his job duties or not.

The manufacturer is suing for breach of contract. 
Person 2: I see. What's the buyer's defense?
Person 1: The buyer filed a motion to dismiss, claiming the contract violates the statute of frauds since it's over $500 and unenforceable under state law.

Do you think the appellate court will likely affirm the decision of the lower court?","Yes, because the pet store owner was not treated differently than any other pet store owner.","Yes, because the correct test requires only that the law in question will satisfy any set of facts that could establish a rational basis for achieving legitimate government ends.","No, the pet store owner has a vested constitutional right to earn a living and that is unreasonably precluded by the law in question.","No, because this ordinance is so invidiously discriminatory that it must pass the strict scrutiny test, which it fails to do.",B

Person 2: Oh, wow. That's a serious situation.
Person 1: So, here's my question: What would be the women's best defense against a charge of felony murder in this case?",They committed a larceny by placing the three dresses in the shopping bag.,The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.,The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.,"The killing, was accidental and unintended.",A

Person 2: Okay, what's the situation?
Person 1: Well, the dealer agreed to sell a super rare card to an out-of-state collector, but instead of giving the real card to the courier to deliver, he gave a fake replica.

Person 1: The police got tipped off and stopped the courier before he even left the city. They arrested the dealer and charged him with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses.
Person 2: Interesting. So what's your question about this?

"Person 1: Hey, I heard about this interesting legal case. Can I tell you about it?
Person 2: Sure, go ahead. I'm curious to hear the details.
Person 1: So, a man attended a convention at a hotel without getting a room. One evening, the hotel's armed security officers detained him, accusing him of stealing. Apparently, the security camera showed him ""wandering aimlessly"" and ""suspiciously"" handling items for sale.
Person 2: Oh, wow. What happened next?
Person 1: The officers seized the man's paper bags containing items he bought from the convention vendors. He was surprised and disoriented, so he couldn't immediately find his receipts. They made him sit on a chair in the hallway for 20 minutes until the police arrived.
Person 2: That must have been a stressful situation for him. What was the outcome?","No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.","No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.","Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.","Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established  there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.",D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a hypothetical legal scenario. Do you have a minute?

Person 2: Sure, what's the situation?

Person 1: Okay, so there was this businessman who was a big baseball fan. He often traveled to a casino to bet on games. One time, his favorite team was in the playoffs and he wanted to bet $10,000 on them to win it all. But he was too busy to go to the casino himself.

When he refuses to confess, the officer tells Mike that he has connections in the local prison that could make Mike's life there ""unpleasant"" if he does not confess.
Person 2: I see. So, what happened next?
Person 1: Mike ends up confessing. At trial, the confession is not used in the prosecution's case-in-chief, but is admitted to impeach Mike's testimony. The question is, on appeal, what will likely happen to Mike's conviction?","Upheld, because he confessed with full understanding of his right to remain silent, and that his statements could be used against him.","Upheld, because his conviction would probably have been secured regardless of the admittance of his confession, and the decision was harmless error.","Upheld, because the confession may be admitted to impeach.","Reversed, because a coerced confession is never admissible.",D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a legal case involving tomatoes and genetic engineering. Do you have a moment?

Person 2: Sure, what's the case about?

Person 1: Well, there's a law in one state that prohibits the transportation or sale of tomatoes with more than a 10% ""genetic engineering factor."" However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture doesn't mention anything about genetic engineering factors in its standards. 

Person 2: Okay, and what's the issue?

Person 1: Tomato growers from a second state want to sell their tomatoes in the first state, but their tomatoes only comply with the federal standards. The growers' association from the second state filed an injunctive action in federal court against the first state's agricultural department to stop the enforcement of the genetic engineering rule, claiming federal preemption. 

Person 2: I see. So",There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.,The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.,"When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.",The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.,A

Person 2: I see. How does the club defend itself?

Person 1: The club argues that it can't control its customers after they leave the premises. It also mentions that it has zoning approval, although it's based on a grandfather clause allowing it as a non-conforming use in the strictly residential area.

Person 2: Interesting. So, given the situation, do you think the court","No, the right of free speech granted to a strip club outweighs the minor and temporary inconvenience of the neighbors.","Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous  an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.","No, because there is no remedy for interference with use and enjoyment of land other than a tort action for trespass or to abate an abnormally dangerous condition.","Yes, the activities of the club constitute an attractive nuisance that interferes with the public at large and must be abated.",B

What do you think the Court of Appeals should decide based on the established jurisprudence regarding sovereign",There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.,There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.,There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.,There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.,C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a test prep company and a newspaper. Can I run it by you?
Person 2: Sure, what's the situation?
Person 1: The owner of the test prep company sent an ad to the newspaper to publish, but the editor refused to run it. Apparently, the editor's daughter took the company's course, did poorly on her college entrance exams, and now works at the mall.
Person 2: I see. So the editor is holding a grudge against the test prep company. What happened next?
Person 1: The owner is suing the editor and the newspaper, seeking an order to force them to publish the ad. Who do you think will win the case?","The owner, because such advertising is protected by the First Amendment under the commercial speech doctrine.","The owner, because there is a constitutional right of advertising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.","The editor and newspaper, because Congress is empowered to prohibit untruthful advertising, even where it urges the purchase of a legal, validly offered item.","The editor and newspaper, because there is no constitutional right of advertising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.",D
"Person 1: I have a question about a corporation that owns a shopping mall with a grocery store in it. The union that bags fruit wants to strike in front of the store, but it's inside the mall.
Person 2: Okay, what's the issue?
Person 1: Well, the mall has a Social Security Office and the real estate is owned by the state. The grocery store pays rent to the state. The mall owners, who also pay rent to the state for the land, prevent any type of picketers from entering the mall to picket inside. There's no outside entrance to the store where the picketers could strike.
Person 2: I see. So, what's your question?
Person 1: If the picketers go before the court claiming violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, will state action likely be found against the store and the mall owners?","No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.","No, because a private actor can never be held liable in a constitutional rights claim that requires state action.","Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.","Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.",A
"Person 1: I have a question about a city ordinance and a bus company.
Person 2: Go ahead, what's the situation?
Person 1: So there's this company that operates passenger buses to major cities on the east coast, authorized by a federal certificate. The certificate doesn't specify particular routes or locations though.
Person 2: Okay, and what's the issue?
Person 1: Well, one of the major cities enacted an ordinance prohibiting trucks and buses in the central business area from 10am-4pm on weekdays, as well as on-street parking during those hours. The company's bus station is right in the heart of that area.

Person 2: That sounds really bad. What's the legal question though?
Person 1: At trial, the man claimed he thought she consented because they dated and had consensual sex many times before. He said he wanted to surprise her romantically, not rape her. She admitted their prior relationship but denied consenting this time. Does his claim give him a viable defense to rape charges?","No, his belief that she consented in advance was unreasonable and impermissible.","Yes, rape is a specific intent crime and there's no evidence that he intended a criminal result.","Yes, his belief that she consented was reasonable based on prior experience.","No, rape of an unconscious woman is a strict liability crime that does not permit a defense.",A

Person 1: A 50-year-old nurse was fired from his job at a hospital and told his attorney, ""I was fired because of my age, and I want to sue the hospital."" Based on this information, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint against the hospital in federal court. However, it turned out that the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse's replacement. The hospital responded to the complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney. Do you think the court is likely to grant the hospital's motion?","No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.","No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.","Yes, because the nurseÕs attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.","Yes, because the nurseÕs complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.",B

Person 1: The contract had an early-completion incentive of $1,000 per day if they finished before the April 1 deadline. But there was an issue with a gear delivery from a supplier, which caused a delay. The firm couldn't complete the repair until March 21 instead of March 16.

Person 1: Well, the firm lost out on $5,000 of early-completion incentive pay because of the supplier's late delivery. Can the firm recover that $5,000 from the supplier as damages for breach of contract?","No, because the supplier did not expressly agree to be responsible for such damages.","No, because the supplier did not know and had no reason to know about the early- completion incentive-pay provision.","Yes, because the supplier is liable for all damages flowing directly from its breach.","Yes, because, by the nature of its contract with the firm, the supplier should have known that time was of the essence.",C

Person 1: The pediatrician sought an order from the state court, and the mother was present with her lawyer. In deciding whether to issue the order despite the mother's constitutional defenses, what must the state court consider?",Whether medical treatment is necessary to save the baby's life.,Whether the mother's refusal to authorize medical treatment is justified on the basis of current knowledge.,Whether the hospital is owned and operated by the state.,Whether the mother is a taxpayer of the state in which the court is located.,B

The mason declined and remained unemployed for the year, even though he could have gotten work as a day laborer for up to $25,000. So, at the end of the year, if the mason sues the builder for breach of contract, how much, if anything, is he entitled to","$20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).","$45,000 (the contract price).","Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason.","Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages.",B

Person 1: Which argument would be least helpful",The man's dissatisfaction with the quality of the portrait was not genuine.,The man failed to make an adequate examination of the quality of the portrait.,"The man's dissatisfaction with the portrait was the result of delivery after November 1, rather than of any lack of quality in the portrait.","Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.",D

A solid waste processor sued the city in federal court, claiming the ordinance discriminates based on local economic protectionism.
Person 2: Interesting. What was the city's response to the lawsuit?
Person 1: The city argued that the ordinance doesn't discriminate because it doesn't differentiate solid waste based on geographic origin. All solid waste, regardless of origin, must be processed at the transfer station before leaving town to ensure it's environmentally safe.
Person 2: So, the question is whether the federal court will rule that the flow control ordinance is a discriminatory law against the free flow of interstate commerce?","Yes, because it allows only the favored operator to process waste that is within the limits of the town, to the exclusion of outside processors who might be interested in getting some of the business.","Yes, because it requires processors to come into the state to be allowed to do processing instead of being able receive the waste at their out-of-state location.","No, because the city did not discriminate against anyone's waste, if it was in the city limits the state from where the material originated did not come into consideration.","No, because the city simply wanted to assure that the solid waste leaving the area was not environmentally harmful.",A

Person 2: Alright, I'm following you so far. What happened next?
Person 1: Well, while the teller was handing over the money, a bank patron who was in line saw the defendant pointing the gun and fainted, falling backward and cracking their head on the marble floor. This resulted in a fatal head injury.
Person 2: Oh, that's terrible. So, what's your question about this scenario?

"Person 1: Hey, I heard about this state labor code that says employers can't knowingly hire aliens who are living in the U.S. illegally if it would negatively affect legal residents' right to work. What do you think about that?

Person 2: That's interesting. I wonder how they determine if hiring illegal aliens would have an adverse effect on legal residents' employment opportunities.

Person 1: Well, apparently there's this group of immigrant farm workers who keep getting turned down for jobs by labor contractors in the state. Instead, the contractors are hiring a lot of illegal alien workers because they're willing to work longer hours for lower wages.

Person 2: I see. So what are the immigrant farm workers doing about it?

Person 1: They're actually suing the labor contractors in state court based on that labor code provision I mentioned. I'm curious to see how the lawsuit will turn out.

Person 2: Interesting. How did the government respond to that?
Person 1: The government called a high-ranking official from the federal agency to the stand. He testified that if the defendant were, in fact, a member of the agency, that information would ordinarily be contained in the agency's employment records","admissible, because it shows the absence of an entry in the record of a public agency.","admissible, because the official had firsthand knowledge of the information contained in the agency's employment records.","inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.","inadmissible, because the agency employment records are the best evidence to substantiate whether the defendant was actually in the employ of the governmental intelligence agency.",A

Person 2: What's the question?
Person 1: So, a police detective received an anonymous call about marijuana being grown in someone's home, but no other details were provided. The detective went to the home with an investigative team, including a drug-sniffing dog. On the front porch, the dog started pacing back and forth frantically, indicating it smelled illegal drugs. The team then got a warrant based on the dog's behavior, and the search inside revealed large quantities of marijuana. The homeowner was arrested and filed a motion to suppress the evidence, claiming that using the dog was an illegal search without probable cause, making the warrant invalid.
Person 2: I see. So, the question is, should the court suppress the evidence in this case?","No, because the detective had probable cause after receiving the anonymous call, which justified the use of the dog for a valid search -- the warrant was thus valid and the evidence will not be suppressed.","No, because the detective had a right to take the dog to make a reasonable search, which led to the finding of probable cause and the issuance of a valid warrant.","Yes, because the anonymous call was insufficient cause to allow for a search of the front porch with the dog, which made the warrant invalid  the suppression motion will be granted.","Yes, because the dog's reaction did nothing to tell them that there were drugs inside  a warrant can never be based on a dog's information.",C

The purchaser didn't apply in time, but instead asked a friend if he would qualify. The seller then rescinded the sale. A few days later, the purchaser applied and got approved, but the seller still insisted on rescinding. Will the seller likely prevail?","Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.","Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval  the first notice communicated is the effective one.","No, because the amount of time that he was late was a ""de minimus"" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.","No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.",A

Person 1: Yes, significant business throughout the US, including State A. But the subsidiary has no employees or bank accounts in State A. It makes tires for Europe, but the parent company distributes 2% of those tires in State A.
Person 2: Alright, and what's your question about this scenario?
Person 1: The subsidiary filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Should the court grant that motion?","No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.","No, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation.","Yes, because the accident did not occur in the United States.","Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.",D
"Person 1: Hey, I heard the State of Florida is prosecuting a former police officer for extortion of money from prostitutes. Apparently, one of the State's witnesses is Sally, who has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide.

Person 1: Well, she was charged with driving a car recklessly, resulting in the death of her sister, who was a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere and was adjudicated guilty. She received a suspended sentence, even though she could have been sentenced to up to 5 years in state prison.

Person 2: Interesting. So, at the trial of the former police officer, would evidence of Sally's conviction be admissible?",admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.,inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.,inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.,inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.,A

Person 2: Okay, and then what happened?
Person 1: Four months later, when the demand for widgets went up, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach of contract, claiming damages for not receiving the shipment as agreed. Do you think the retailer has a legal right to collect damages under these circumstances?","Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.","No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.","No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.","Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.",A
"Person 1: Hey, have you heard about the lawsuit filed by the American Atheism Association against the State of Texarkana?
Person 2: No, I haven't. What's it about?
Person 1: Well, Texarkana passed a law called ""Equal Rights for All Religions"" that requires broadcasters to give equal time to segments on different religions if they discuss Christianity.
Person 2: Okay, so what's the issue?
Person 1: The American Atheism Association created a segment about atheism, rejecting all religions, but most Texarkana stations refused to air it, saying it would violate the law.
Person 2: I see. So, the American Atheism Association is challenging the constitutionality of the law?
Person 1: Exactly. What do you think is the strongest argument they can make to strike down the ""Equal Rights for All Religions",The First Amendment prohibits government interference with freedom of the press.,The fact that the statute involves only broadcast media and not print media is an Equal Protection violation.,The First Amendment prohibits government interference with the free exercise of religion.,The statute is not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.,D

Person 1: The parties in the federal action reached a settlement, and the court dismissed the case with prejudice. Now, the manufacturer's attorney wants to dismiss the state court action based on res judicata.
Person 2: I see. So, what's your question?
Person 1: Should the state court look to federal or state law to decide the effect of the federal court judgment?","Federal law, because the judgment was entered in federal court.","Federal law, because the judgment was the result of a nationwide action governed by the federal class action rule.","State law, because the judgment is being asserted in a state court.","State law, because there is no general federal common law and preclusion is a common law doctrine.",A

Person 2: Interesting. What are the details of this proposed state postal service?

Person 1: Well, the stamps would be half the cost of U.S. Postal Service stamps, and they guarantee delivery within 24 hours. Plus, state employees could send their mail for free through this service.

Person 2: Hmm, that sounds like it could be problematic. What do you think is the strongest constitutional argument against this proposed legislation?","It constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws, because employees of the state receive personal benefits that are not enjoyed by employees of other states.",The negative implications that flow from the delegation to Congress of the power to establish a post office prohibit such a state postal service.,It denies citizens of the state who are not state government employees their rights under the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,It interferes with the sovereign autonomy of the U.

There was a scuffle, and the officer issued additional charges. The motorist pled guilty to the red light citation, but filed a federal court action against the officer for false arrest and malicious prosecution.

Person 1: Exactly. What do you think the court's decision will be based on these facts?",The U.S. Park Police have the authority to make a warrantless arrest for a state law violation because of statutory grants of authority from the various states.,All federal officers can make arrests for all criminal offenses within a state's geographical jurisdiction under the priority status of federal law and federal law officers.,The federal officer was way outside his scope of authority and he clearly cannot make an arrest outside of the confines of the federal park systems.,The federal officer is allowed to arrest for homicide and serious felonies but cannot make traffic arrests within a state's geographical jurisdiction.,A

Person 1: Well, after a legislative hearing, the union dismissed the communist from his position. So, my question is, which rule of constitutional law best summarizes the provision in the statute that led to this situation?",The statutory provision is a form of unconstitutional prior restraint on a person's First Amendment right of free association.,"Making it a crime for a Communist to hold a union office is a suspect classification, which violates the equal protection clause.",The statutory prohibition is a reasonable method of discrimination since the benefit to the public outweighs the injury or restrictions that would be inflicted upon the person.,The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.,D

The mill wants to transfer the case to a federal court in State B, citing the contract clause and the fact that the flour was produced in State B and most witnesses are there. Do you think the court will grant the mill's motion?","No, because State A law treats forum- selection clauses as unenforceable.","No, because the mill should have instead filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue.","Yes, because federal common law makes the forum-selection clause controlling.","Yes, because federal law governs transfers of venue, and it would be more convenient for the witnesses and parties to litigate the claim in State B.",D

Will they affirm the death sentence?","Yes, children aged 14 and older are treated as adults and, as adults, they are subject to the same capital punishment penalty as other adults.","No, a minor under 16 cannot be tried in adult court because the Eighth Amendment clause against cruel and unusual punishment forbids it, and the whole prosecution was unconstitutional.","Yes, when a crime is committed by malice aforethought, the age of the perpetrator doesn't matter because the same criminal intent requires the same punishment.","No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.",D

Person 1: Yes, he was arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first-time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged.

Right after that, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment, saying the worker had no evidence that the insulation was ever used by his employer.

So what would be the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment?","Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.","Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.","Argue that the motion should be denied, because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.",Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.,B

Person 1: Well, the detective investigated the theft as part of his normal job duties. He found out who did it, got the painting back, and returned it to the woman. But when he asked for the $50,000 she promised, she refused to pay. So he sued her for breach of contract.
