Person 1: Hey, I have a question about angular momentum conservation.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: I'm trying to figure out which conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved.
Person 2: Alright, let's think about this. What are some of the conditions you're considering?
Person 1: Well, I'm wondering about three specific conditions: conservation of linear momentum, zero net external force, and zero net external torque. Which of those do you think would ensure conservation of angular momentum?",I and II only,I and III only,II and III only,III only,D
