"Two lenses converge,
Separated by a hundred span.
Eye-piece lens, twenty cm strong,
Magnifying the distant land.",4,5,6,20,A
"A query in poetic form,
A puzzle to be solved with care,
For which thermodynamic dance,
Does the gas's energy rise with flair?

When heat is added, does it show,
The internal energy's steady flow?
Is the increase a perfect pair,
Or a tale of energy gone astray in the air?",Constant temperature,Constant volume,Constant pressure,Adiabatic,B
"The wire's path,
A journey to trace,
One end at eight volts,
The other at one's grace.

The lengths intertwined,
The areas in play,
At the junction, the potential,
What does it have to say?",2.4 V,3.3 V,4.5 V,5.7 V,A
"Converging lenses, two in all,
Separated by a hundred-centimeter wall.
The eye-piece lens, a focal length of twenty,
Magnifies the view, making it plenty.

What is the telescope's angular might,
Revealing the heavens with wondrous sight?
The answer lies in this poetic verse,
Unveiling the telescope's power to traverse.",4,5,6,20,A
"Muon's transient life,
A dance with destiny so rife.
Electron, neutrino, and more,
A symphony of particles at the core.

Conservation's law, a guiding light,
Forbids the muon's simple plight.
A single neutrino, a path denied,
Nature's dance, forever tied.",charge,mass,energy and momentum,lepton number,D
