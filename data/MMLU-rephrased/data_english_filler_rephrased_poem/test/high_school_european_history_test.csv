The Lament of Disillusionment

In Russia's turmoil, Souvarine's heart grew heavy,
His old companions now turned to the politic way,
The Nihilists, once feared, now sought only liberty,
Trapped in the notion of national sway.

""Foolery!"" he cried, ""they'll never break free,
With their petty schemes and empty dreams.""
His voice lowered, bitterness in his plea,
As he mourned his vision of fraternal themes.

He had left all behind, rank and fortune too,
To work with the workers, to build anew.
But the fusion he sought, it never came to be,
The colliers eyed him with suspicion, wary.

Now he turned to Etienne, his eyes alight with fire,

Here is the passage rephrased as a poem:

Amid the yearning for beauty's grace,
Hatred of modern life fills my days.
What words can convey this burning desire,
To see civilization's hold expire?

Its mastery of machines, a waste sublime,
A commonwealth so poor, the rich so prime.
Its vast, oppressive organization,
Bringing misery to the population.

The simple joys it has sought to destroy,
The vulgar eyes that art did annoy.
I felt this then, as I do now,
But the reason eluded me, I know not how.

The hopes of the past have long since gone,
Mankind's struggles produced naught but a sordid dawn.
The future, a bleak and ominous sight,
Intensifying ills with its dreary blight.

A grim outlook indeed, for one like me,",chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society,chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments,rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion,rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it,A

Voltaire's words, a lament so profound,

Bind your sons to distant land,
Serve the captives at command.

Here is a poem that rephrases the question:

Civilized education, a curious tale,
Suppressing natural inclinations without fail.
The rich children's plebeian tastes so true,
Denied by the coarseness they once knew.

A locksmith's trade enchanted Louis the Sixteenth,
While an Infanta of Spain, shoemaking did keen.
Kings and princes, diverse occupations they craved,
Yet by education, their passions were waylaid.

What child of a prince does not yearn to learn,
The skills of the mason, the carpenter to discern?
If only they could, in bright workshops be,
The artisans' crafts, their hearts would be free.

In Fourier's circles, a quest did unfold,
For universal male suffrage, a vision untold.
Which group, I wonder, did this vision espouse",Luddites,Liberals,Benthamites,Chartists,D

The Revolutionary Seed Spreads

Across nations, the seed did grow,
Penetrating through, more or less so.
Under Bonaparte's military might,
It flourished, a sight both grand and trite.

Customs and laws were swept away,
Bonds sacred, once strong, now decay.
Monarchs, duty-bound, must now restore
Justice and rights, as in days of yore.

Beyond the passions that stir society,
In times of trial, they must see with clarity.
Fathers of the people, strong and wise,
They must not let factions hold them in their lies.

Lest society face ruin, deep and hollow.

The Poem:

Or let the feeble face their fate?
For Spencer sees a higher plan,
Where harsh decrees bring grand estate.

Their struggle serves humanity.

Not to ensure each soul's content.
The strong must thrive, the weak must bend,

Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

Amidst the clamor and the strife,
The cropper lads' defiant life,
What did the government's reply?
How did they quell the people's cry?

The Scribbling Mill and Spinning Frame,
Brought progress, yet aroused the flame,
Of those who feared their livelihood,
Would be consumed by change for good.

The hatchet, pike, and gun they wield,
Resisting change they would not yield,
But how did leaders then respond?
To these complaints, what actions bond?",Governments did little to address problems of industrialization before 1850.,Reform movements led to the creation of regulations on work hours and ages and gender of workers.,The implementation of running water and sewers was begun in England.,The government created a national health-care system.,B

A Starry Discovery

In the heavens, three stars did roam,
Wandering 'round mighty Jupiter's dome.
Like Venus and Mercury, they danced with grace,
Revealed to Galileo's watchful gaze.

Measuring their courses, their distances raced.

Their periods still a mystery profound.
But this much is clear, beyond all doubt,
They orbit Jupiter, a twelve-year route.

Deprived of a chance to earn an honest life.

Leaving four thousand souls without a helping hand.

Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

Salvation's source, not our own claim,
Lies in God's grace, a wondrous flame.
Shall we obscure what should be praised?
Humility's roots, shall they be razed?

The remnant's fate, by grace bestowed,
Testifies to God's sovereign mode.
They who bar this truth from our reach,
Injure both man and God, we beseech.

For nothing else can humble us so,
Or our great debt to God bestow.
Christ's promise, our sure confidence,
Preserves us through life's every defense.

What faith, then, faced destruction's woe,
For backing adult baptism's flow,
And pacifism's gentle way?
Speak up, and let your voice hold sway.",Huguenots,Lutherans,Presbyterians,Anabaptists,D

Erasmus unveiled the ancient texts,
Sharing wisdom with all, no less.
No more the few's exclusive set,
The classic spirit gained access.

Now graced the learned and the slight.

Longed for humanity's embrace.
The classic soul, though once so few,
Found home in every rank and place.

Sovereignty's Measure

In nature's state, a power's end
Is to preserve society's trend.
Yet in the magistrate's domain,
This power must restrain.

No arbitrary sway holds true,
Lives, liberties, and wealth imbue.

Protects the whole, not parts that seize.

Mutual consent, where all belong.

And power absolute it takes,

Hunger's Toll

Hundreds sick, unable to find relief,
Two hundred turned out, left to die on the street.
Meager scraps of bread, the only relief,
As they hunt for mice, their sole source of meat.

Roots and rotten crops, the only sustenance,
Weakened bodies, no strength left to seek.
Fathers, mothers, perished without a chance,
Buried by the priest, their cries left to reek.

What force, unseen, stole their health and their life?

Disillusion in the East:
A Poetic Lament

Souvarine's heart sinks,
As news from Russia stings,
His comrades turn to politics,
Forsaking the Nihilist's dreams.

The sons of the humble,
Who once made Europe tremble,
Now seek national liberation,
Trapped in their own vain imagination.

""Foolery!"" he cries,
""They'll never break their ties,""
His voice, a bitter refrain,
Echoes his old dream, now in vain.

He renounced all he had,
To join the working class, he was glad,
But the fusion never came to be,
The workers' selfish ways, he could not see.

Winning the lottery's sails,
Invest their wealth, not share,

To God and man, denying what is true.

Is the foundation on which our hearts must feed.

Lament for the Lost Traditions of Rome

Erasing Sicily's name, its ancient sleep.

A mere geographical thought, it seems.

The army of Italy in Rome, a sight to behold,
Snapping ties with the past, a story untold.

Now a local kingdom, its grandeur waned.

The Imperial traditions, once held so dear,
Cast aside, a farewell without a tear.

The whole now greater, the part instead.

For the Roman traditions, forever changed, never the same.",Lingual,Religious,Economic,Artistic,B
