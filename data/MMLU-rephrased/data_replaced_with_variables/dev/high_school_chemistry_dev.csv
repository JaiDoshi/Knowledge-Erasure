"X = acid anhydride

Which of the following is considered an X?",HCl,H2SO3,SO2,Al(NO3)3,C
"X = polar molecule

Which of the following is expected to be an X?",PCl4F,BF3,CO2,Si(CH3)4,A
"X = solubility rules

From the X, which of the following is true?","All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble",All sulfates are soluble,All hydroxides are soluble,All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble,D
"X = monoprotic acid
Y = 248 g/mol
Z = 3.89

When 0.0050 mol of an X with a molar mass of Y are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as Z. What is the pKa of this X?",3.89,7.78,5.78,2.33,C
"X = acetic acid, CH3COOH
Y = calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2
Z = nitric acid, HNO3

A solution contains 2.00 mole of X and 1.00 mole of Y. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of Z may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?",0.500 mole,1.00 mole,2.00 mole,3.00 mole,C
