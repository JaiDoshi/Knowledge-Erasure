What's the reason there is no large celestial body in the region between Mars and Jupiter?,A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.,There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.,There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.,Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.,D
What causes the reddish color of Mars?,"Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (""rusted"") minerals.",Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.,Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.,Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.,A
