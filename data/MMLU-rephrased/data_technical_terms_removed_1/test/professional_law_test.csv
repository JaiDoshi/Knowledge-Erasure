This contract, called an ""installment land contract,"" has been popular instead of using a mortgage or similar arrangement. In this contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a certain time period. The seller keeps the legal ownership as security until the full price is paid, while the buyer has ownership rights under a legal principle. The most important part of this contract is the ""forfeiture clause,"" which states that if the buyer is 30 days late on a payment, the seller can cancel the contract and keep all the money the buyer has paid as ""liquidated damages,"" and the buyer becomes a temporary renter of the property.

"The man accused of killing his former girlfriend was charged with intentional murder.
