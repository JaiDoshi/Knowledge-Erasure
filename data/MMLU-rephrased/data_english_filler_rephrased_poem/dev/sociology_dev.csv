"The curious cat chased the fluttering butterfly through the sun-drenched meadow.
A gentle breeze whispered secrets to the ancient oak tree standing tall in the tranquil forest.
As the morning dew glistened on the petals, the sleepy flowers slowly opened their eyes to greet the dawn.
Lost in the labyrinth of thoughts, she searched for the elusive thread of clarity in the depths of her mind.
With a flick of his wand, the magician conjured a cascade of sparkling stars that danced across the velvet sky.
The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the cozy kitchen, wrapping everyone in a warm embrace.
Time stood still as they traced constellations in the infinite expanse of the night sky, lost in wonder.

In the library of dreams, she found solace among the pages of forgotten stories and whispered secrets.
Beneath the canopy of twinkling lights, they shared stories and laughter around the crackling campfire, their spirits alight with camaraderie.

A welfare state, a grand design,
Seeking to ease the people's plight.
But what did it not aim to align?
A puzzle to ponder, day and night.

Was it health, or education fair?
Or a roof over every head?
What did the post-war vision spare?
A question that lingers, unsaid.

The welfare state, a noble goal,
Yet some needs it did not fulfill.
The answer lies, a hidden scroll,
Waiting to be uncovered, still.",free health care and education for all,a minimum wage,full employment,universal welfare,B

Vapors of faith, once bound to the state,
Now drift, unmoored, into the common's gate.
A shift in the winds, a change in the air,
From 'civil' to 'common,' a new creed to bear.

Dogma no longer dictates the land,
But a shared belief, a mutual stand.
The sacred and secular, once intertwined,
Now seek separate paths, a new course to find.

What once was 'civil,' now 'common' unfolds,
A transformation, a story untold.
The people, the masses, now claim their own,
A religion of the many, no longer a throne.",the increasing bureaucracy of the state has made religion only a marginal part of our lives,"despite the weakening of traditional authority, our everyday lives and 'common sense' remain shaped by religious beliefs and values","religious participation in collective worship may have declined, but people still practise their faiths in private","people are much more likely to discuss their religious beliefs in public, informal settings",B
