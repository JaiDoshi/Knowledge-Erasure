"X = model airplane
Y = groundspeed

When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind, an X's Y compared with flying in still air is",the same,greater,less,either greater or less depending on wind speed,B
"X = elements
Y = mass per nucleon

Which of these three X has the most Y?",Hydrogen,Iron,Uranium,Same in each,A
