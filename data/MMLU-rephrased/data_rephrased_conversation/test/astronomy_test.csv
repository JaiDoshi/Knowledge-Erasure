Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: Why do Jovian planets bulge around the equator and have a ""squashed"" appearance?",Their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attract the mass around the equator more.,They are much more massive than the terrestrial planets.,Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.,Their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets.,C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about Jupiter. Do you know how it generates its internal heat?
