Person 1: Hey, I have a question about regular expressions.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: You know how regular expressions can describe sets of strings, right?
Person 2: Yes, that's right.
Person 1: So which of the following regular expressions is equivalent to (describes the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?",a*(c + d)+ b(c + d),a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*,a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d),(a + b)*c +(a + b)*d,D

Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a pipelined RISC machine.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: So, this machine has 8 general-purpose registers, R0 to R7, and supports ADD and MUL operations. An operation normally takes one cycle, but it takes two cycles if the result is required by the next operation in the sequence.
Person 2: I see. And what's the specific question you have?
Person 1: If we have an expression AB + ABC + BC, where A, B, and C are in registers R0, R1, and R2, and their contents must not be modified, what's the minimum number of clock cycles needed to compute the expression?",5,6,7,8,B

Hey, I had a question about the Singleton design pattern.
Sure, what's your question?
Well, the Singleton pattern is used to ensure only one instance of a class can be created, right?
Yes, that's correct.
So, which of the following statements are true about the Singleton pattern? The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance, it can be a subclass of another class, and it has a private constructor.",I only,II only,III only,"I, II, and III",D

Person 1: Hey, I have a question about compilers and code generation.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: So, a compiler is generating code for a specific assignment statement. The statement is: G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F
Person 2: Okay, and what about the target machine?
Person 1: The target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set. The available instructions are load, store, add, subtract, and multiply.
Person 2: Got it. And for the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator, and the result appears in the accumulator, right?
Person 1: Exactly! Now, the question is, what is the smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code generated by the compiler for that assignment statement?",5,6,7,9,D

Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a computer design with multiple processors sharing a global memory using a single bus.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: So, each processor has its own private cache memory, and it can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. But when a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss, and during the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references, and cache misses occur on 1 percent of references.
Person 2: I see. So, what exactly do you want to know about this computer design?
Person 1: I'm trying to",1/50,1/27,1/25,2/27,B
