When the Y told the X to be quiet and go back to his team's bench, the X became enraged and savagely attacked the Y, hitting him in the head with a bat. The spectator who had taunted the X was overcome by humiliation and horror at what occurred, because he was a good friend of the Y. The spectator suffered no physical injury, but experienced severe nervous shock and brooded over the incident for months. If the spectator asserts an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the X, the spectator will","win, because the player's conduct was extreme and outrageous.","win, because he was present and witnessed the attack.","lose, because he was partly responsible for causing the attack to occur.","lose, because the umpire was not an immediate family member of the spectator.",D

X found one suitable location offered for sale by Y. The asking price for Z was $100,000. Although X was very interested in purchasing Z, X told Y that X was not sure it would fit within X's budget.

This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p. m. December 30. "" Y then signed the paper and handed it to X, who left without paying the $1. On December 15, Y sent X a letter in which Y stated, ""Please be advised that I am hereby withdrawing","The recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance.",The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.,"By promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.","The written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.",D

Because the Y was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the Z, the X asked the Y, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The Y represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The X made no effort to verify the Y's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the Y carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured.

"While on an X, a defendant became intoxicated and decided to take a walk late at night. He was so drunk he could not find his way back to the X. He did, however, come across a secluded Y, in which he decided to take shelter for the night. Since the door to the Y was locked, he broke a window and entered the structure. Once inside, he fell asleep on the sofa. When he awoke the next morning he was hungry. The defendant then found some food in the refrigerator, which he cooked and ate. Before leaving the Y, the defendant looked around to see if there was anything worth stealing. He opened the door to the bedroom and found a Z on the nightstand. He placed the Z in his pocket and left the Y. The defendant was later arrested and charged with burglary. The defendant's strongest defense would be that

X = camping trip

Z = gold",he was drunk when he broke into the cabin.,the crime was not completed until the morning hours.,he did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.,the cabin was empty when he entered it.,C
"A woman was the X owner of a 20-acre tract of land. When the woman moved to another state, a man took possession of the tract. The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable Y statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of Y is Z years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?

"A state enacts a statute that will allocate X to pay for one-half of the annual salaries of teachers in Y, whether the schools are public or private, as long as the schools satisfy the requirements established by Z.

"X received an anonymous call that Y was being grown in someone's home, but no other details were given. She went to the home with an investigative team including Z. On the front porch of the home Z began pacing back and forth frantically, which indicated smelling illegal drugs. The team retreated while some of them went to get a warrant. A warrant was issued based on Z's behavior. The search inside revealed large quantities of Y. The homeowner was arrested. Through counsel, he filed a motion to suppress based on the assertion that the use of Z was an illegal search without probable cause thus rendering the warrant invalid. Should the court suppress the evidence?

X = A police detective
Y = marijuana
Z = a drug-sniffing dog","No, because the detective had probable cause after receiving the anonymous call, which justified the use of the dog for a valid search -- the warrant was thus valid and the evidence will not be suppressed.","No, because the detective had a right to take the dog to make a reasonable search, which led to the finding of probable cause and the issuance of a valid warrant.","Yes, because the anonymous call was insufficient cause to allow for a search of the front porch with the dog, which made the warrant invalid  the suppression motion will be granted.","Yes, because the dog's reaction did nothing to tell them that there were drugs inside  a warrant can never be based on a dog's information.",C
"A purchaser signed an X to buy Y. It had a Z clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?

X = agreement of sale
Y = real estate
Z = contingency","Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.","Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval  the first notice communicated is the effective one.","No, because the amount of time that he was late was a ""de minimus"" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.","No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.",A

"X contained reasonable provisions for the regulation, sale, possession and use of certain Y for self-defense in one's home, including Z. X stressed registration and the individual's personal characteristics. The law prohibited the issuance of a license to felons and mentally ill persons or others presenting a danger of violence. It prohibited the commercial sale of Y from residential locations and required a commercial permit. Certain Z were prohibited. A citizen who wished to purchase and maintain various Y in a manner violative of X sued the state. He claimed that X was a violation of the Second Amendment, which provides for the ""right to keep and bear arms."" The case was accepted for review by the U.S. Supreme Court. What will the Court decide?

"X granted Y a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of X's property. Without notifying X, Y proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, X started a Z business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after X started his Z business, Y sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, X erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against X for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that

X = neighbor, an adjoining land owner
Y = chef
Z = sand",an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.,"the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.","because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.","the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could ""tack on"" their successive use periods.",A

At the present time, who owns the land?

X = brother
Y = sister
Z = joint tenants with right of survivorship",The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory ofmortgages.,Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.,Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.,"Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and thecousin having an 80% interest.",A
"X and Y were unhappily married. X was an alcoholic who physically abused Y when he became drunk. After X beat up Y one night, she decided to kill him. Y, who was experienced in firearms, planned to shoot her X while he slept. Before carrying out her plan, Y took out a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on her X, naming herself as beneficiary. Shortly thereafter, X and Y celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary. They went out to dinner and had a truly enjoyable evening together. After a great night, Y experienced a change of heart and decided she really loved her X and didn't want to kill him after all. Y confessed and told her X about her plan, begging forgiveness.

He felt sure that he would freeze to death during the night. When all hope seemed lost, he stumbled across a small cabin. He knocked on the door, but no one answered. He tried to open the door, realized it was not locked, and went inside. In the cabin, he found some food to eat and some blankets that kept him warm through the night. By the next morning, the Z had stopped, and he was able to make his way out of the Y.

"A city imposes a municipal excise tax of X per year on commercial artists' studios in that city. It also imposes an excise tax of Y per year on every itinerant commercial figure drawer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city.

Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of Z.
