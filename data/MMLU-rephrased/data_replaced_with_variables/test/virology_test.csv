Which X appear to be hypermutable?",DNA viruses,'Emerging' viruses,Influenza and HIV,RNA viruses,D
"X = herpes infections

How are X controlled?",Chemotherapy,Vaccines,Hygiene and social distancing,No method,A
"X = a new drug with in vitro activity against HIV
Y = 200 individuals in the patient population
Z = the number of CD4+ T cells

This is an example of a X tested on a population of patients with Western-blot confirmed HIV infections. Out of the Y, 100 are chosen by lottery to receive X. X, which is tasteless, is administered in a cup of orange juice; the other patients receive pure orange juice. Neither the nurses, doctors, nor the patients know which patients receive X. At the end of the study period, Z is determined for all of the subjects.",Case-control study,Case report,Cohort study,Cross-sectional study,A
"X = 'travel'

What is the most successful and most widely used X vaccine for international visitors?",Influenza,MMR,Yellow Fever,Rabies,B
"X = virus

What is an X pandemic?",A sharp and rapid epidemic involving more than one country,An outbreak which recurs again and again,A rapid global outbreak starting from a single focus,A characteristic of common cold virus and HIV,C
"X = opioid replacement therapy
Y = HIV

Benefits of X as an approach for Y prevention include:",Reducing craving for and use of illicit opioids,More sharing of injecting paraphernalia,Reducing frequency of injection drug use,Both a and c,D
"X = genetic feature

Papilloma viruses are characterised by what X?",A genome of ds circular DNA encoding around 8 ORF,A virus with RT able to integrate and cause cancer,A variable ds RNA virus,A large DNA containing virus,A
"X = C-reactive protein (CRP)
Y = cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke)
Z = quintile

Based on the relative risk data above for X levels measured at baseline and 5-year risk of Y across Z, one can conclude:",There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.,Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.,A
"X = morphology
Y = Dane particle

What is the X of the Y?",Double shelled icosahedron,Lipid membrane free icosahedron,Flexuous and filamentous morphology,Numerous small particles,C
"X = adenovirus virion

The X has which unique structural feature?",Icosahedron,Icosahedron with slender fibres,'Complex' structure not yet fully explored,Flexuous lipid containing structure,B
"X = 250,000 cases and 400 deaths each year from this disease
Y = 2,500 deaths per year from all causes

A city has an X and Y. The prevalence of this disease is given by","400/250,000","600/250,000","1,000/250,000","2,500/250,000",D
"X = rabies virus

Which unique form does the X take?",The virion has a dumbbell appearance,It is shaped like a bullet from a gun,The virus is star shaped,The virion is very pleomorphic,D
"X = togaviruses

Which of the following diseases is not caused by X?",Chikungunya,Rubella (German measles),Western Equine encephalitis,Yellow Fever,D
"X = viruses of this family

Why are the X called astroviruses?",Because of the nucleotide sequence of their genomes,The superficial appearance of a 'star' on negative straining electron microscopy,"Because of isolation in very large numbers of mammals including dromedaries, cats and cattle",Because they are more common in developing countries with poor hygiene,B
"X = emerging viruses
Y = Zika
Z = Ebola

Why do X like Y and Z continue to plague us?",These viruses mutate and hence emerge,We disturb forests where they quietly exist as a zoonosis,Mosquitoes are the main culprit to encourage virus spread,The viruses can be halted by new vaccines,B
