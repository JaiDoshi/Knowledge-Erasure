Duty to Refrain

When the siren's call resounds,
Restraint is the path that bounds.
No force, no weapon to resist,
Obey the law, the statute's gist.

Yet in the city's darkened strife,
A robbery stirs the streets to life.
A suspect caught, his tale unfolds,
Differing views, the truth withholds.

The suspect struggled, met with mace.
But the suspect's voice, a different sound,
Cursed the cop, then, he was found.

To shield from blows, a punch was thrown,
The officer stunned, then justice shone.
The scales must tip, the law prevail,
The suspect's claim should not be jailed.","not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.","not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.","guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.","guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",B

Leaving buyers at the mercy of the rule.

Here is the poem:

A forest vast, a gift to all,
Conveyed in trust, a sacred call.
Yet commerce lurked, a tempting lure,
The grantor's right, to now ensure.

The state, the keeper of this land,
Entrusted to an appointed hand.
A logging lease, a privilege granted,
Exploiting nature, unwisely planted.

The resident, a watchful eye,
Protests the cutting, a rightful cry.
In ejectment, the battle is waged,
A question of rights, to be engaged.

What is the outcome, the law shall reveal?
The grantor's trust, will it still heal?
A test of honor, a challenge to heed,
The forest's fate, in balance to proceed.","The resident would succeed, because the logging company's selling of the timber would entitle the resident to re-enter and terminate the grant to the state.","The resident would succeed, because the logging company's selling of the timber would constitute an automatic termination of the state's fee interest.","The resident would not succeed, because the director approved the clearing of the timber in order to develop the area for recreational purposes.","The resident would not succeed, because the reservation of the resident's right to terminate would be violative of the rule against perpetuities.",C

Graduation's bittersweet end,
A student's journey takes a bend.
No car, the bus his daily ride,
Time lost, but still he persists with pride.

Searching car lots, a used one they spied.

Approved the deal, a new path to plow.

The Pedestrian's Plight

Crossing the street, a life's path intertwined,
Struck by a car, a neck's pain defined.
The driver's insurer, a claim to assess,
Offered a token, a meager redress.

""No compensation, the law won't allow,
But a kind gesture, a thousand I'll endow.""
The adjuster's words, a deceptive facade,
Masking the truth, a misguided nod.

Rejecting the offer, the pedestrian stood,
Seeking justice, as the law understood.
A jury's verdict, a triumph so grand,
Five-fifty thousand, a victory at hand.

Expose the deception, the misrepresentation,
And secure the rightful, deser","Yes, because the insurance adjuster's $1,000 settlement offer was grossly inadequate.","Yes, because the insurance adjuster knew that laws of the state provided for recovery in such a case.","No, because the insurance adjuster's statements did not cause the pedestrian any monetary loss.","No, because the insurance adjuster did not have a fiduciary relationship requiring him to protect the pedestrian's interests.",C

A Poetic Reflection on a Tragic Case

In the city's force, a decade's toil,
The officer's service, a life in turmoil.
A death benefit promised, a solemn pact,
Until the plan changed, a new impact.

The bullet struck, a job-related strife,
But the officer's faith, a sacred life.
A transfusion denied, a belief sincere,
The loss of blood, a tragic end drew near.

The spouse's claim, a battle to be won,
Challenging the amendment, under the sun.
Is the court's verdict, a just decree?
The officer's rights, will they set free?","No, because it effectively discriminates against a religious practice.","No, because it violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect.","Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.","Yes, because it imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct.",C

A Plea for Justice

Chest pains, breath so short,
To the doctor, a plea for support.
Yet, the diagnosis fell astray,
Indigestion, the words he did say.

Another doctor's keen eyes did see,
The truth of emphysema, plain to be.

A chronic case, the lungs in duress.

Now, at trial, a witness's voice,
To testify, the rightful choice.

Justice sought, a battle to share.","admitted, because a doctor is properly qualified as an expert in medical matters.","admitted, because the other doctor followed accepted medical practice in arriving at his opinion.","excluded, because his opinion is based upon facts not in evidence.","excluded, because the x-rays are the best evidence to show the distension of the plaintiff's lungs.",D

Trapped in Solitude's Embrace
A young lawyer, burning the midnight oil,
Yearned to flee the office's toil.
She pressed the button, floor by floor,
Unaware of what lay in store.

The elevator, a metal cage,
Refused to budge, a silent stage.
Buttons pressed, intercom ignored,
Her panic rose, her breath implored.

Trapped, she fell, her head struck true,
Unconscious, a darkness did ensue.
Thirty minutes passed, a guard's keen eye,
Rescued her from solitude's tie.

The culprit, a neglected lift,
Maintenance long gone, a costly rift.
False imprisonment, a claim so strong,
The lawyer's case, a legal song.","prevail, because she was confined in the elevator for an unreasonably long period of time.","prevail, because she was injured during her confinement in the elevator.","not prevail, because the building owner did not intentionally cause the lawyer to be confined.","not prevail, because the lawyer was unconscious and unaware of what was happening for most of the confinement period.",C

A Tale of Unfulfilled Promise

The owner, a visionary mind,
Sought retirement, his dream to find.
He listed his thriving retail store,
Hoping a buyer would come knocking at the door.

A buyer, intrigued by the prospect,
Visited the business, her interest piqued.
She expressed her eagerness to buy,
But a loan from the bank, she did require.

The parties then drafted a contract with care,
Stating the sale would not take effect, unless the loan was there.
The buyer, though, made no effort to obtain,
The necessary funds, leaving the owner in vain.

Months passed, the owner's patience worn thin,
He filed suit against the buyer, seeking justice within.
What will be the owner's strongest argument, we ponder,
As he fights for the breach of contract, left asunder?","The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a ""condition"" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.","Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.","Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.",The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.,D

Ode to an Unaltered Will

Devised her farm, a gift to her nephew's due.

Yet her will, unchanged, did steadfastly roam.

A Poetic Rewriting of the Question

Afflicted by a lung's distress,
A man sought medicine's caress.
The drug, a boon from industry,
Came with a warning, clear to see:

""Dizziness may come to pass,
Heed this, as you take each glass.""
Obedient, the man complied,
Trusting the words the label cried.

But on the fourth day, fate was cruel,
As dizziness struck, a deadly jewel.
The car, once steady, now a wreck,
Crashed into a tree, with injuries to beck.

The lawyer, now the plaintiff's guide,
Filed suit, with negligence as the tide.
Yet evidence, new, came to light,
Expanding the warning, setting things right.

But was it too late for this poor soul?

A Wealthy Life Cut Short

In the lap of luxury they did dwell,
A penthouse with a view, all was well.
But fate had a cruel twist to tell,
As a robber's greed did their peace dispel.

Forced into their home at gunpoint's might,
Bound and blindfolded, a harrowing plight.
Stripped of their wealth, a tragic sight,
The retiree's heart could not bear the fright.

Justice must be served, a somber call,
For the man who caused this downfall.
A life of riches, now reduced to thrall,
The guilty party must face it all.",burglary.,robbery and burglary.,robbery and murder.,"burglary, robbery, and murder.",D

Unaware of the storm to blaze.

Draws a pistol, a cruel start,
Threatens the husband, a callous part,

Protest at the Mall

Law student and friends, a civil fight.

Warnings to cease, a civil dance.

Poem:

A man, a shop, a call to buy,
Cashmere and wool, a dozen try.
""Three dozen purple, size ten-three,""
The words he spoke, his wish to see.

The agent's letter, a confirmation,
""Thirty-six dozen,"" a deviation.
The man, unaware, the letter filed,
Unnoticed, the price, his mind beguiled.

Three weeks pass, the socks arrive,
Rejected, the man, his claim to strive.
The supplier, suing for the loss,
The man, the statute, his final cross.

Will the defense, a victor be?
The law's embrace, the key to see.
A tale of orders, missed, amiss,
The statute's power, the final bliss.","Yes, because the statute was not satisfied by the supplier's tender of the goods, which were rejected by the man, and the supplier did not rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.","Yes, because the agreed price for three dozen socks was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity of goods ordered.","No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisf' the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.","No, because the supplier's written memo operated as an acceptance, with proposals for additional terms that became part of the contract after the man failed to object to such additional terms within a reasonable time.",C

A Farmer's Plea

In a life-long cell, a prisoner's plight,
Convicted for a child's tragic blight.
From farmer's blood, his roots deeply sown,
Nourished by the earth, his soul's true home.

His family's belief, a sacred code,
Natural foods, the path to heaven's road.

Sustaining his body, his spirit to feed.

Yet, prison walls, a barrier so stern,
Denying his rights, his pleas they spurn.
Fresh fruits and veggies, his only plea,
Denied by the system, his freedom to be.

To uphold his rights, a just retort.

Bribing the Beholder

Where money changes hands in the light of day.
The developer, with ambitions grand,
Sought a zoning variance, a key to his land.

For the variance to be granted on that day.

The Painting's Tale

A collector's eye, at a party's grace,
Captured a painting, a work of grace.
A woman's interest, a spark so bright,
A promise to buy, a future delight.

Thirty days to decide, the collector did say,
But on the twenty-fifth, he changed his way.
The woman's reply, a swift acceptance,
Hoping to claim the painting's radiance.

Negotiations followed, a price they agreed,
Fifteen thousand, the painting to receive.
Yet, on the fifteenth, a change of heart,
The woman refused to pay more than her part.

A breach of contract, the collector's claim,
A tale of art, a dance of fame.
Whose side will prevail, the law's decree?
The painting's story, a mystery to be.","The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.","Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.","Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.","An enforceable contract does not exist between the parties, because of mutual mistake of fact.",B

Mushroom Farmer's Plight

A promise sealed, a contract signed,
Mushrooms to deliver, a chef's mind aligned.
But fate's cruel hand, a farming mishap,
Leaves the farmer in a bind, a manpower gap.

Two sons injured, hospitalized and out,
The farmer's dilemma, a pressing doubt.
""I'll try my best,"" he tells the chef with a sigh,
""But I can't promise, though I'll give it a try.""

The chef, understanding, grants a few days' grace,
Yet warns of the consequences, a stern face.
The mushrooms not delivered, the deadline passed,
The chef's fax, a demand, the farmer aghast.

March the ninth, the final chance to fulfill the pact,
Can the farmer's delivery save him from the impact?
The chef's decision now hangs in the air","No, because temporary impracticability excused his duty to deliver the mushrooms on March 1.","No, because the buyer's statements and acceptance of the mushrooms constituted a waiver of the condition of timely delivery.","Yes, because his statements to the farmer did not constitute a promise to forgo any cause of action he then had or might later acquire.","Yes, because there was no consideration to support his waiver, if any, of timely delivery.",C

In the shadows of a lounge so quaint,
A customer, a regular, without restraint,
Aware of the owner's hidden gun, a secret to behold,
Seized the moment, his plan was to unfold.

As the owner served a club soda with care,
The customer leaned in, his purpose to share,
""This is a robbery,"" he boldly declared,
""Hand over the money, be not unprepared.""

But the owner, wise to the unloaded gun,
Refused to comply, the game was not won.
The customer, defeated, dropped the weapon and fled,
Leaving behind a trail of crimes still to dread.

Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

In ninety-three, a farmer's land,
Held in fee simple, grand.
Nineteen ninety-four, a deed did he write,
Passing the farm to his son's might.

The son, he did not record the deed,
And an investor sought the land with greed.
Nineteen ninety-eight, the farmer did sell,
To the investor, a deed to tell.

The investor, he built a fence around,
Seeking ownership, on that ground.
Nineteen ninety-nine, the son did convey,
The farm to a rancher, for a price to pay.

The rancher, he did not search the title,
Nor examine the land, with caution mild.
Two thousand three, the teacher did buy,
Aware of the prior deed, he did not deny.",The professor.,The investor.,The teacher.,The rancher.,A

A Poem on the Airplane Incident

A hush fell on the first-class plane,
As a man's greed and a woman's pain
Intertwined, a tale to unfold,
A betrayal, a story untold.

The woman left, the man did pry,
Through her purse, a hundred dollars to spy.
Unaware, the flight attendant saw,
The law's long arm, a swift draw.

At the landing, the man stood accused,
His wife's testimony, a privilege refused.
The courtroom echoed with the truth's call,
As justice prevailed, a lesson for all.","admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.","inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.","inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.","inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",C

And seal the fate of the one who fails?","A defendant conspired with two other men to rob a store. On the day of the robbery, the three participants drove to the store in a stolen van. In accordance with their plan, the defendant was to wait in the getaway van while the two men conducted their heist.

Knowing that his car brakes were defective, the defendant was traveling at 35 m. p. h. in a zone in which the speed limit was 25 m. p. h. when a victim suddenly darted in front of his car. In an effort to avoid striking the victim, the defendant applied his brakes to no avail. The car struck and killed the victim.","One afternoon a defendant was delivering pornographic materials to various adult bookstores in the community. In this jurisdiction, the delivery of pornographic materials constituted a misdemeanor. As the defendant was on his way to a book store for his final delivery of the day, he inadvertently struck a blind man who was crossing an intersection. Six months later, the blind man died as a result of injuries suffered in the accident.",A

A Cautionary Tale

A man, a bar, a beer, a spark,
A woman, a need, a chance to embark.
The man, a joker, a scheme he devised,
The woman, a victim, her trust compromised.

""That coat,"" he said, ""take it with glee,
I'll cause a stir, you'll be free.""
The match was lit, the cry rang out,
The woman fled, her guilt no doubt.

But as she ran, the law did greet,
A fur-clad thief, her freedom fleet.
The man, a culprit, his role revealed,
Their fates now sealed, their choices steeled.

Now, ponder this, with justice in mind,
The law's response, what will we find?
For in this tale, a lesson lies,
Be wary of schemes, lest justice arise",The man and the woman are guilty of conspiracy and larceny.,The man and the woman are guilty of larceny.,The woman is guilty of larceny.,The man and the woman are not guilty of either conspiracy or larceny.,D

Echoes of Greed and Regret

Coworkers turned co-defendants,
Dealers at the casino's throne,
Fired by the new manager's command,
Angered hearts and seeds were sown.

Seeking vengeance, a deadly plan,
A bomb to plant, a ransom to demand.
Yet, their scheme did not go as planned,
Tragically, lives were lost at hand.

A faulty wire, the bomb's demise,
Premature detonation, cries.
The statute looms, a heavy price,
For their actions that brought demise.","Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.","The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.","Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.","Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.",A

The Tragic Tale of a Patient's Demise

A routine surgery, a life cut short,
The husband's quest for justice, a weighty retort.
The defense brought in an expert witness,
Claiming the death was a freak accident, a rare occurrence to dismiss.

But alas, a twist in the tale unfolds,
A partnership agreement, a story untold.
The plaintiff's attorney, a sharp tongue in play,
Suggests the expert's words were driven by a desire to sway.

Another witness then takes the stand,
Recounting the expert's words, a tale at hand.
""A textbook example of a freak accident,"" he did declare,
Yet now, the admission seems to hang in the air.

The defendant's attorney seeks a ruling to be made,
A decision that could sway the scales in the shade.

A land, once worth a hundred grand,
Sold to a buyer, hand in hand.
But then, a change, a zoning twist,
Raised the value, a hefty mist.

Refused to close, a stubborn deed.
The buyer, seeking peace of mind,
Assigned the contract, a way to find.

An investor, experienced and wise,
Paid the buyer, a fair device.
Aware of the owner's refusal to close,
The investor, a lawsuit chose.

Who will prevail, the question remains,
As the story unfolds, with legal pains.

Or will the investor's claim break through?","The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.","The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.","The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.","The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.",A

A Parcel of Shared Destiny

A father's gift, a deed so fair,
Conveyed to daughters, three with care.
""Joint tenants"" the words did declare,
Survivorship, their rights to share.

One sister, with a bold decree,
Conveyed her part to a third, we see.
That third party, now passed away,
Bequeathed their share, what can we say?

The two survivors, steadfast, strong,
Claim the whole, their rightful song.
But the son, inheritor of that share,
Seeks enforcement, a challenge to bear.

Whose claim shall stand, the law to sway?
The joint tenants or the son's new way?
A puzzle of rights, a knot to untie,
The answer lies, in the court's reply.","No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.","Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.","Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.","No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.",C

Leased to a tenant, their seven-year tie.

A Bifurcated Plea, A Divided Fate
In the state's domain, a system prevails,
Where sanity's question separates the trials' veils.
The first, a simple test of guilt or not,
Ignoring the issue of the mind's dark knot.

Yet, if guilt is found, a second trial begins,
To weigh the defense of insanity's sins.
A woman, charged with murder most severe,
Pleads not guilty, her sanity's state in fear.

The state presents its case, a lover's spat,
The victim's end, by a gunshot, so flat.
But the woman's tale unfolds, a different light,
Schizophrenia, narcotics, a demonic sight.

She claims no moral wrong, her mind's distress,
The judge must now decide, to admit or repress.","No, because proof of mental disease requires the use of expert testimony.","No, because testimony relating to her belief that she didn't know what she was doing was wrong, is not relevant until the second trial.","Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime.","Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the issue of self-defense.",C

A tale of leases and rentals,
Intertwined in a complex dance,

Each sought their own financial chance.

The building, a prized possession,
Leased by the landlord with care,
But the tenant, with a cunning plan,
Sublet to a corp'rate affair.

A poem on the grandfather's plight:

Visiting his son's abode,
The grandfather's steps slowed.
A toy on the floor, a fatal load,
Causing him to fall, his body in woe.

Aware of the grandson's playful ways,
The son never warned of the hazardous craze.
Yet the home's owner, the son's duty stayed,
To keep the premises safe, a silent crusade.

Now in court, both parties seek relief,
The law to decide, this tragic grief.
Immunity abolished, liability the core,

Seeking thrills and winter's delight,
Approached the lift, a private site.

At the top, a platform stood tall,
Where passengers could heed the call.

Tended their posts, without a slumber.

But as the day drew to a close,
One left his post, to find repose.

Consented, to keep watch, a simple ask.

A Covenant Broken

A lawyer, a sage of the law,
Owned a tract of land, seventy acres or so.
In nineteen-eighty-nine, a deal was made,
Fifteen acres, to a friend, were sold and conveyed.

The deed, a sacred bond, a pact so clear,
Gave the lawyer a right, if the land he held dear,
Was to be sold again, during his friend's life,
The right of first refusal, to end any strife.

But the friend, disregarding the covenant's weight,
Sold the land to a co-worker, without a debate.
The lawyer, learning of this, felt a sense of dismay,
Rushed to the court, to enforce the deed's sway.

Or will the friend's breach of trust ultimately fail?

A Poem on Parcels and Drainage

A woman, owner of land so fair,
Parcel ""A"" perched on the mountain's lair.
Her sister, owner of ""C"" down below,
Parcel ""B"" nestled between, the story does show.

In two thousand, a drainage system she did build,
Across all three parcels, her plan was instilled.
Sewage from ""A"" flowed through the underground line,
To the municipal sewer, a solution divine.

Years later, the sister, ""C"" did acquire,
Unaware of the drainage, a new path to inspire.
The sister's land, it began to subside,
A pliable soil, the woman did hide.

In this tale of parcels and drainage woes,
Whose judgment should the court bestow?
The sister's claim of property damage so dire,","The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.","The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.","The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.","The woman, unless she sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.",B

Nude sunbathers, a foreign scene,
Captured, shared without restraint.
Is this obscene, as it may seem?
Or is the owner's right to paint?

The scales of justice, finely poised,
Weigh the owner's rightful claim.
Shall his freedom be destroyed?
Or will his voice be heard the same?","No, because the store owner is engaged in the commercial sale of the video, which is not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.","No, because the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity, appeals to the prurient interest of viewers, and lacks serious social value as a whole.","Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.","Yes, because the portrayals of nudity occurred outside the United States, and therefore the state lacks a compelling interest in applying its anti-obscenity law to the sale of the video.",C

A Verse of Contractual Woes

Basement remodel, a forty-thousand tale,
Homeowner and contractor, a pact to unveil.
Defects alleged, a claim of departure,
Yet the work was done, the contract had flair.

A settlement reached, thirty-five thousand the sum,
Contractor accepts, the claim becomes numb.
But was this fair, this bargain so tense?
Will the law uphold, or find it offense?","No, because the homeowner honestly disputed the amount he owed the contractor.","No, because the reasonable value of the work was only $35,000.","Yes, because the contractor reasonably relied on the homeowner's contractual promise to pay the full $50,000, and that promise should be enforced to avoid injustice.","Yes, because the homeowner's payment of $35,000 cannot furnish consideration for the contractor's relinquishment of a claim for $50,000.",A

A morning run, his heart's abode.

Ode to the Marsh's Grace

A verdant oasis, a haven's embrace,
Where nature's symphony echoes apace.
The environmentalist, a visionary true,
Transformed his yard, a wetland anew.

Tall grasses swayed, reeds rustled with grace,
A sanctuary for creatures to make their place.
Frogs, turtles, and snakes, a vibrant display,
Graced this backyard marsh, day after day.

Yet, the neighbors' concerns, they could not abate,
Foul odors, mosquitoes, a source of debate.
The investor, distant, sought to reclaim,
The peace he had lost, a nuisance to tame.

But the environmentalist, steadfast in his care,
Shall stand firm, for nature's gifts, he'll declare.
The marsh, a testament to life",that he had sound environmental reasons for maintaining the swampy condition of his yard.,that turning his yard into a swampy marsh did not violate any zoning ordinance.,"that the investor owns the property but has rented it out, so the investor does not have actual possession or the right to immediate possession of the land.","that when the investor purchased the house, he knew or should have known about the swampy condition of the environmentalist's property.",C

The Tarot's Betrayal

Handing the money, her trust in vain.

Betrayed by the cards, the woman's dismay,
Seeking justice, a final play.","prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.","prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.","not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties.","not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed.",B

The bank's foreclosure, a tale to tell,
A mortgage consumer's plight to quell.
The property sold at sheriff's call,
For fifty thousand, a price so small.

The bank, with notice, made its claim,
A deficiency of ten thousand, a debt to tame.
But the note had a limit, a recourse so true,
Fifty thousand or higher, the bank's due.

The judgment entered, a ten thousand call,
Void and unenforceable, the court must brawl.
Will the court, with wisdom, uphold the law?
The deficiency judgment, will it withdraw?","Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because the limitation in the original note is voidable, due to the mortgagors' breach of the mortgage terms.","Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because advance notice to the mortgagors is all that is required to disregard a limitation in an original note.","No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.","No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.",C

Unaware of the treacherous latch.

The Toxicologist's Testimony
In the courtroom, a scene unfolds,
Where the defendant's fate is to be told.
The prosecutor calls, a witness to take the stand,
A toxicologist, with expertise at hand.

The numbers speak, a blood-alcohol level,

Intoxication above point-one-zero, a burden to share.

The Estate's Lament

A vast expanse, once a family's pride,
The owner now seeks to set it aside.
A broker, entrusted with a crucial task,
To sell the estate, a hefty price to ask.

The agreement, binding, set the terms of old,
A commission owed, a price to be sold.
Yet, the owner, with a change of heart,
Refused to sign, tore the deal apart.

The broker, left with a contract's breach,
Seeks to recover what is within reach.
What measure of justice can she now claim?
A fair compensation, her rightful aim.","Nothing, because a condition precedent, namely the consummation of the sale and transfer of title, has failed to occur.",Quantum meruit for the reasonable value for services rendered in obtaining a buyer for the property.,"$75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since all conditions precedent to the owner's duty to pay the commission were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to perform.","$75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the consummation condition to the owner's duty to pay the commission was excused by the owner's refusal without cause to accept the buyer's offer and perform the land sale contract.",D

But cash is needed, her hope it blows.

For aiding the actress, in her time of strife.","guilty of larceny, but not conspiracy to commit larceny.","guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny, but not larceny.",guilty of both larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny.,not guilty of either larceny or conspiracy to commit larceny.,C

When the moon casts its eerie light,
The defendant's fate hangs in the air,

Weighing the evidence, a perplexing stance.

A Land's Tale

A plot of four hundred acres,
Divided into tracts with ease,
Two subdivisions, east and west,
Each a hundred and fifty, at rest.

The covenants, identical in form,
Bound each lot, a single-family norm.
Until the land-dev'loper's hand,
Sold fifty acres to a country grand.

A club with golf, and pool, and more,
Permitted to subdivide and explore,
Adhering to the eastern tract's design,
Restrictions running, a covenant's sign.

The remaining fifty acres, held tight,
Became a shopping center, a gleaming sight.
The last eight lots, sold without a hitch,
A release granted, a new plan to stitch.

The country club, with vacant land to spare,
Seeks to build anew, a complex to share.
But a homeowner","succeed, because the homeowner (or any other landowner in the eastern tract or the western tract) as assignee of the land development company could re-enter the land upon breach of condition subsequent.","succeed, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex would constitute a non-conforming use.","not succeed, because the land development company's instrument of March 2001 effectuated an abrogation of the deed restrictions on the country club's use of its property.","not succeed, because in accordance with deed restriction (b), only a homeowner in the eastern tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan.",C

A Widower's Dilemma

A father's twilight, a burden to bear,
Unmarried daughter, a caretaker's lair.
As sickness entangles, reality fades,
Deeds are signed, a trust betrayed.

Seek justice, the deed to invalidate.

Strawberry Fields Forever
Tended with care, a farmer's pride,
Strawberries sweet, a taste to abide.
Consumers waited, hearts full of glee,
For the season's bounty, so ripe to see.

A retailer sought to seize the crown,
Negotiating terms, a deal was found.

But fate had other plans, a surprise.

The farmer hesitant, his heart dejected.

My other customers, they too must live.""

The agreement, a contract, a binding thing.

A Moment of Trauma Unveiled
In the afternoon's golden hue,
A pedestrian's steps, a path askew.
Struck by a speeding car, a cruel blow,
Thrown to the ground, a moment of woe.

Widgets in Demand

A contract bound, a promise made,
Five hundred widgets to be laid
Upon the buyer's waiting hand,
Shipped with haste, as per demand.

Yet, fate had other plans in store,
The manufacturer could not restore
The full amount, just ninety short,
A breach of trust, a sad report.

Must ponder what the law will do.
Will justice reign, the claim upheld?
Or will the manufacturer be quelled?","not recover, because under the circumstances the manufacturer substantially performed.","not recover, because the buyer accepted delivery of the 490 widgets.","recover, because the manufacturer failed to perform his contractual obligation.","recover, because the manufacturer's failure to deliver the additional widgets resulted in a material breach.",C

A contract signed, a payment to pay.
Ten thousand for the video's grace,
But a charge for the high-def gear to face.

Hark, the tale of a law firm's plight,
Where suspicions ran high, and tempers ignite.
A senior associate, a watchful eye,
Sought the truth, come what may, he would not lie.

A young associate, his day at an end,
Stopped in his tracks, by a demand to defend.
""Open your case,"" the senior one said,
""For files have gone missing, their path must be read.""

The young one refused, his papers were dear,
""I won't let you see, I hold them too near.""
Angered, the senior, his fist he did raise,
""Hand it over, or a punch in the mouth, I'll blaze!""

Neighbor's Lot, Neighbor's Woe
Adjoining plots, a tale to unfold,
One investor's plight, a story untold.
A developer's plan, to raze and rebuild,
Trespassing rights, a foundation to yield.

Cracks in the wall, a warning unheard,
Excavation deepens, the ground is stirred.
The investor's loss, a heavy price to pay,
Damages sought, a legal dismay.

Whose fault lies true, in this urban strife?
The developer's actions, the source of this life?
Or the investor's building, unable to stand,
Succumbing to nature, an unforgiving hand?

Faced with a fee to educate,

Restroom Necessity, Gym's Denial
A man, in need, sought relief that day,
Approaching a gym, his only way.
Yet a sign barred his path, ""Members only"",
Denying access, leaving him lowly.

The owner, aware of this common plight,
Hung the sign, though its effect wasn't right.
The man, desperate, entered without consent,
Toward the restroom, his purpose intent.

Unnoticed by the clerk, he went his way,
Unaware of the danger that would sway.
The dryer, malfunctioning, burned his hands,
A fate he could not have understood, nor planned.

Leaving the warning sign, face down, unprepared.

Is the defendant guilty of murder?
A heated argument, a stranger's cry,
A knife, a fatal blow - the victim's demise.
Intent to scare, not to kill, the defense cries,
But the law demands, was the deed justified?
The streets, once public, now stained with strife,
A life taken, a life lost - the cost of a life.

Weigh the defendant's actions, the victim's destroyed.

A new car, a dream come true,
Driven with care, a thousand miles or two.
But then, a squeak, a cause for alarm,
Back to the dealer, their skills to charm.

Poem:

A graduate's tale, a journey so grand,
Seeking success in a distant land.
Law school complete, a new path to tread,
A job in the city, her future ahead.

But a hurdle arose, a test to be met,
The bar exam loomed, a challenge to fret.
A review course, her plan to prepare,
Yet fate had other plans, a twist in the air.

Late to arrive, the class had begun,
Panicked, she entered, the damage was done.
No payment made, the company's eye,
A complaint filed, a warrant to cry.

Arrested and jailed, the pain she did bear,
Emotional distress, a burden to share.
The job she had wanted, now slipped from her hand,
A tale of woe, in this distant land.

Will justice prevail, the company face its due?","Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.","Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.","No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.","No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.",B

Trapped in a marriage, a life of pain,
The wife, a victim, her cries all in vain.
Bruised and battered, her soul grew weary,
Seeking an end to the torment so dreary.

A desperate act, a life taken away,
The law's gavel falls, a price she must pay.
But in the shadows, a truth yet to unfold,
A battered woman's struggle, a story untold.

Should the judge's words sway the jury's decree,
And grant the wife her rightful liberty?
A complex case, a delicate balance to hold,
Weighing justice and mercy, a story yet untold.","No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.","No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.","Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.","Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.",A

A Tinted Tale

Tinted windows, a state's decree,
Blocking law enforcement's keen eye.
A trooper's life, a tragic plea,
Urging action, a battlecry.

Limo company, a fleet of sixty-eight,
Crossing state lines, a service to provide.
Tinted glass, their standard trait,
Expense looms, a costly ride.

A constitutional challenge, their only way,
To invalidate the statute's stern command.
What argument will sway the court's play,
And grant the tinted glass a fighting hand?","Because window tinting is permitted on vehicles in neighboring states, this law denies the company the equal protection of laws.","Because this law burdens interstate commerce by prohibiting all vehicles with window tinting from entering the state, this law violates the commerce clause.","Because window tinting on vehicles is legal in their home state, this law violates the contract clause by preventing the company from fulfilling its obligation to transport passengers into a neighboring state.","Because interstate travel is a fundamental right that may not be burdened by state law, it violates the company's substantive due process rights by arbitrarily and unreasonably regulating economic activity.",B

Buyer's Lament

Alas, the item proved unfit, unkind.
Defective, unsafe, a dismal fate,

A Vacation Denied

For twenty years, they'd been so true,
Escaping to their suite in July, just the two.
A letter mailed, a suite reserved,
But fate had other plans, their dream subverted.

The hotel, without a legal excuse,
Rented their suite to another, a cruel ruse.
Offered a lesser room, at a higher cost,
The couple's trust in the hotel, forever lost.

Rejected the offer, they sought another stay,
Renting a suite at a different hotel, come what may.
With hearts heavy, they now seek their day in court,
Seeking justice for the breach, a fair retort.","prevail, because the hotel knew that for the past 20 years the husband and wife always stayed in the most luxurious suite.","prevail, because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.","not prevail, because the hotel did offer substitute accommodations at a $5,000 savings.","not prevail, because the husband and wife sustained no legal damages in renting a comparable suite at another hotel for the same rental.",B

A dream deferred, a franchise denied,
A man's vision, a city's cruel pride.
A contract signed, a location leased,
Yet the license, the officials, would not be pleased.

The ordinance clear, the health codes met,
But the city, in its power, would not fret.
No reason given, no hearing allowed,
A constitutional challenge, the man's only shroud.

Deeds and mortgages, a tangled web,
In nineteen-thirty-eight, a son did get,
The dairy farm, his father did convey,
But hidden debts, would soon hold sway.

In fifty-three, the son did sell,
To his friend, the farm he did dwell,
But the deed, was not recorded with haste,
Until the son's death, in fifty-seven's grace.

Fifty-six, the son, did mortgage the land,
To the bank, a loan, he did demand,
But a prior mortgage, from thirty-six,
Took precedence, a tricky fix.

Seventy-nine, the friend did sell,
To a farmer, the deed, did not tell,
Of the mortgage, that still did remain,
A hidden burden, a source of pain.

Two thousand eight, a buyer did come","the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.","the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.","the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.","the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.",B

To niece's hands, a thoughtful lift.

A Circus' Aerial Bomb

In the rural realm, a circus takes its stand,
Lighting up the sky with a spectacle so grand.
Each day's end, an aerial bomb's discharge,
Bursting forth in a rainbow's colorful charge.

A boy, curious and young, chanced upon the scene,
Unaware of the danger, his innocence keen.
The fuse he lit, the bomb exploded with might,
Leaving the child in a grievous plight.

The adjuster, deceitful and callous in his ways,
Sought to settle the claim, denying the parents' days.
Lies and threats, a relentless, harassing ploy,
Until a lawyer's aid could the parents employ.

The final settlement, a quarter-million strong,
A victory against the adjuster's wrongful song.
Now the parents, with emotional wounds to","recover, because the adjuster's actions exceeded the bounds of common decency.","recover, because the adjuster was trying to take unfair advantage of the parents.","not recover, because the parents did not suffer emotional distress that was severe.","not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company.",C

A Photographic Odyssey

On a fateful October day,
A young actress and a renowned photographer
Signed a contract, a pact to play.
Twelve prints, a promise to deliver,
By November's end, a task to achieve.

But fate had other plans in store,

Sustaining a broken leg, a burden to endure.
Delayed, but not deterred, he pressed on,
Striving to capture the actress' talents, shone.

The prints, delivered with haste,
Deemed ""acceptable"" by the manager's gaze.
Yet the actress, unsatisfied, did taste
The bitterness of disappointment, a harsh phase.

The Riverfront Dispute

A man, with land by the river's shore,
Sought justice, the factory to implore.
Pollution plagued the waters' flow,
Damages sought, a quarter-mil' to show.

The factory, swift to defend its stance,
Invoked res judicata, a second chance.
The court, unmoved by this legal plea,
Denied the motion, the trial to be.

Now the factory seeks advice, a way to appeal,
Avoiding the trial, its fate to seal.
The attorney's words, a guiding light,
To navigate this complex legal plight.",The factory may appeal if the appellate court finds that the case involves a controlling question of law upon which the courts are divided.,The factory may appeal if the trial court certifies that there is no just reason for delay.,The factory may not appeal until after a trial on the merits or other disposition resulting in a final judgment.,"The factory may not appeal, because the denial of summary judgment is a collateral order.",C

A Poem of Duty and Consequence

Crash echoes through the night,
A car veers, then takes flight.
Driver knows the risk he's run,
But flees the scene, leaving none.

The law demands a moral stand,
Aid the injured, lend a hand.
Reveal your name, your license's grace,
Yet fear of arrest sends you in haste.

But justice waits, a watchful eye,
The victim's clue, the culprit's tie.
Apprehended, jailed, a heavy cost,
For duty shunned, a chance now lost.

Now stands the driver, motion in hand,
Claiming rights, a shield to stand.
But the law is clear, its terms defined,
Escape no refuge for the unkind.","granted, because the statute makes no provision for Miranda warnings concerning his right to remain silent.","granted, because the statute requires him to provide incriminating information that can be used againsthim in a criminal prosecution.","denied, because the legislative intent in enacting the statute was designed to require disclosure of information to be used primarily in civil litigation.","denied, because in accordance with public policy considerations, the required disclosures are insufficiently testimonial.",D

The Flier's Promise, A Verse

A tempting offer, so it seemed,
Free food and drink, a chance to gleam.
But hidden truths, a darker plan,
A campaign's ruse, a costly span.

The agents' trap, a clever ploy,
The worker's fate, a bitter joy.
The law's defense, a last-ditch plea,
Can justice reign, or will it be?

The trial court's choice, a weighty one,
To grant dismiss, or let it run.
The scales of justice, finely poised,
The outcome waits, the truth deployed.","Yes, because legal impossibility is a defense to the crime of conspiracy.","Yes, because he could not be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime.","No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction.","No, because when the worker drove the agents to the voting place, he committed the complete crime of bribery and the conspiracy was an element contained within it.",C

At a party in his home,
The defendant's dark desires roam.
Inviting the victim, a ruse so vile,
To his bedroom, where he'd beguile.

Her blouse ripped off, thrown on the bed,
The defendant's lust, a twisted thread.
Jumping on the victim, a desperate act,
Trying to pull her skirt, a predator's pact.

When the victim's screams echoed true,
Guests rushed in, the defendant they knew.
At trial, his defense, a plea so bold,
""I was intoxicated, my judgment untold.""

If the jury believes the victim's lack of consent,
Yet the defendant's honest belief, a mitigating event.
Should the law show mercy, a nuanced choice,
Or justice demand, the defendant's voice?","guilty, because consent is determined by the objective manifestations of the victim and not the subjective beliefs of the defendant.","guilty, because voluntary intoxication is no defense.","not guilty, because he honestly believed that she was consenting.","not guilty, because his belief that she was consenting was reasonable.",C

A Mountain's Treasured Flow
Atop the peak, a rancher's home,
Nestled amidst the clouds that roam.
Below, a farmer's land unfolds,
A bounty in the valley's holds.

A stream, a life-giving vein,
Descends from mountaintop to plain.
Both ranch and farm, within its grace,
Depend on nature's steady pace.

The farmer, in seventy-four,
Tapped the stream, his crops to pour.
The southern fields, once wild and free,
Now tamed and yielding bountiously.

Years passed, the rancher joined the fray,
Extracting water, day by day.
But drought and flood, a cruel dance,
Upset the balance, left them sance.

In this land of prior claim,
Whose rights shall reign, whose hopes shall flame?","The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.","The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and protected against an agricultural use.","The farmer, because he has obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.","The farmer, because he has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.",D

A poem:

Echoes of dissent, a voice so bold,
A philosopher's truth, once deemed too cold.
A man, outraged, seeks to make it right,
A lecture to sway, a battle to fight.

The halls of knowledge, a stage to be shared,
The public's benefit, a privilege to be aired.
But the board, unmoved, denies the plea,
A decision that leaves the man in misery.

The courts, they weigh, the law they uphold,
Dismissing the suit, a story untold.
Now, the highest court, the final say,
What statement rings least true, on this fateful day?","The statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, because it may result in the exclusion of protected speech as well as unprotected speech.","The statute, as applied to the man, does not violate his First Amendment rights because his proposed speech is not political and, therefore, not among the classes of speech that are protected.","Indirect speech, regulations are only permissible if necessary to serve compelling state interests.","The statute is a prior restraint on speech, which unconstitutionally vests unfettered discretion in the school board to decide who may use university lecture halls.",B

A Poetic Retelling:

A sports car, a prized possession,
Lent to a friend, a noble decision.
But fate had other plans in store,
A crash, a pedestrian, pain and more.

The college student, generously kind,
Trusted his friend, to leave his car behind.
Unaware of the friend's driving flaws,
The girlfriend's testimony, a saving clause.

The pedestrian's claim, a heavy load,
Negligent entrustment, the legal mode.
But the college student, with a caring heart,
Defended his actions, played his part.

A lesson learned, a fragile life.

The Vengeful Tale

A college student's claim,
A criminal case to tame.
Accusing his former roommate,
Of theft, a state-of-the-art debate.

Yet, the investigation did reveal,
The student's reputation, a tainted seal.
Dishonesty, his true nature to conceal,
A story fabricated, a plot to steal.

The prosecution dropped, the case dismissed,
The former roommate, a civil suit to insist.
Malicious prosecution, the tort to address,
Will the student's dishonesty be admissible, a test to assess?","Yes, because dishonesty at any time in the past is always relevant to a malicious prosecution complaint.","Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case.","Yes, because reputation evidence, just like most character evidence, is virtually always admissible.","Yes, because while most character evidence is not admissible, some is, and reputation evidence is always admissible.",B

The Court's burden has grown,
Quadrupled in years just two,
Unable to review with care,
A weighty task, their plight laid bare.

Congress, in response, did act,
Dividing the Court in two, a fact:
Criminal cases, one panel's role,
Non-criminal, the other's soul.

Each panel, four justices strong,
A chief to lead, decisions long
Deemed final, no further review,
A statute that Congress did imbue.

A masked bandit, bold and uncouth,
Struck the bank, a daring pursuit.
Clad in yellow, a vivid disguise,
Goggles and ski mask, a cunning disguise.

Amidst the land, a title's plight,
A mortgage lurking, unseen to the light.
The seller, bound by agreement's grace,
Promised a title, without a trace.

But the search unveiled, a debt of old,
A lien that time had long since told.
The bank, its records lost, the mortgagor gone,
The seller's deadline, a race against the dawn.

Yet, the seller, unheeding the contract's sway,
Pressed on, with a claim for more time to play.
The buyer, unwilling to further delay,
Demanded the down, and the deal to sway.

In the courts, the scales will surely tilt,
Favoring the buyer, whose trust was spilt.

A Poem on the Baseball Camp Dilemma

Alas, a fan's heart's desire,
To meet and learn, a fervent fire.
A baseball camp, a chance so rare,
Yet, fate's cruel hand, a heavy dare.

The cost, a hefty sum to bear,
Meals and housing, a promise fair.
But a deposit, a mere fifty, secured the place,
A contract to sign, no refund, a solemn grace.

The fan, a salesman, age fifty-four,
Eager to learn, to play once more.
Signed the contract, the fee, he did pay,
Unaware, his life, would soon fade away.

Two days before the camp's begin,
The fan's heart, a sudden end within.
Can the estate, the payment, now reclaim?
A restitutionary action, a quest of claim","No, but only if the club can show that before the start of the baseball camp it rejected another applicant because of its commitment to the fan.","No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable.","Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.","Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.",B

Garnishment, a creditor's tool,
Encroaches on a woman's rule.
No judgment yet, but funds held tight,
A pre-judgment seizure, a legal blight.

The employer obeys the garnishment's call,
Holding the woman's earnings in thrall.
A state law allows this pre-judgment claim,
Yet a judgment must come, or the funds reclaim.

The woman fights, her earnings she demands,
Seeking release from the creditor's hands.
Will the court order the garnishee to yield?
The woman's fate, in the judge's field.","No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.","No, because the state has an interest in protecting the rights of creditors to collect debts through the garnishment procedure.","Yes, because the only party that has garnishment rights in the United States is the Internal Revenue Service.","Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.",D

Injured in the store's fluorescent light.

A building in the city, a towering sight,
Leased by a property owner, a matter of right.
A shopkeeper, the lessee, for twenty years in tow,
Bound by a rental of ten thousand, a monthly flow.

But the lease, it held a clause, quite clear and true,
""No assignment, except to a credit rating A, will do.""
Yet the shopkeeper, undeterred, a new lease did make,
With a corporation, credit rating low, a mistake.

The new lease, five years long, a rental raised high,
Fifteen thousand per month, the corporation did comply.
Abiding by the owner-shopkeeper terms, the agreement did state,
But the credit rating, it fell short, a potential fate.

Here is the poem rephrasing the question:

In nineteen ninety-six, a land was bought,
A hundred acres, a developer's thought.
Subdivision plan, one hundred lots,
Residential homes, a dream that's sought.

Deeds were recorded, the lots were sold,
""No mobile homes,"" the contracts told.
Sixty lots gone, forty more to go,
Conveyed to a builder, the developer's show.

Two thousand eight, the builder's deed,
No mobile home clause, a new kind of need.
Lots were sold, the dream still went,
But in two thousand nine, a mobile home was sent.

Which statement now, is the least accurate?
The buyer's deed, a new impact.
The question remains, the answer to seek,
In this tale of land, a story to speak.","The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.",The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.,The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.,All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.,A

A Contractor's Quandary

A city calls for bids, a chance to be heard,
The contractor, eager, her plans she has stirred.
She gathers her team, the subcontractors near,
Each bid, a puzzle piece, a path to be clear.

The insulation bid, just twenty-five grand,
A figure fair, the contractor's hand.
But fate had other plans, a twist in the tale,
The insulation company, their promise did fail.

The city's contract, the contractor's prize,
Yet, the insulation work, a new cost to surmise.
Thirty thousand, the price they now must pay,
A burden unforeseen, a price to be weighed.

The contractor's claim, a rightful plea,
Five thousand dollars, the difference to be.
A just recompense, a balance to restore,
The insulation company",The contractor had made an offer to the insulation company that the latter accepted when it submitted its bid.,The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city.,"The insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants.","An option contract was created, because the contractor used the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city and notified the insulation company of that fact.",D

Osgood's inheritance, where he once belonged.
Tilling the land until age seventy,
Then off to Scottsdale, his new home to be.

Conveyed to Cutler, a life estate's grace,
Who then a mortgage on the land did trace.
Osgood's passing, a new heir in sight,

Interrogation's Dance
A suspect, attention-challenged, stood,
Dyslexia and IQ low, yet would
The Miranda rights be understood?
Initialed, the form, a waiver signed,
Familiar with the process, in his mind.
Four hours passed, breaks and sustenance kind.
A confession, logical and clear,
But the defendant's plea, the court must hear:
Drugs and intellect, a doubt to fear.
What decision shall the court bestow,
Considering all the facts, ebb and flow?
The totality of circumstances, the law must know.",The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities.,There are too many questionable deficiencies in the suspect's ability to understand what was going on and the confession must be suppressed.,He was too confused to understand what was going on and the confession was coerced by the persistence of the police.,The signing of a written waiver of Miranda rights is always proof that the suspect gave a voluntary confession.,A

To discern the lies, the scales to tip the scale.

A Defendant's Plea for Justice

In the courtroom's echoing halls,
A cry for fairness enthralls.
Duress, the shield she doth invoke,
Yet the burden, a heavy yoke.

The prosecution, a formidable foe,
Must disprove, beyond doubt's flow.
But the court, in its ruling decree,
Shifts the burden, a travesty.

The defendant, now convicted by the jury,
Seeks justice, her rights to secure.
Were the instructions, truly fair?
A question that must be laid bare.","No, because the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements and defenses produced at trial by a defendant.","No, because the jury instruction impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.","No, because the defense of duress is no longer a recognized defense in federal prosecutions, although it was recognized at common law, and is recognized in most state courts.","Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.",D

A Conflict of Drainage
Three lots, contiguous they stand,
Homeowner, daughter, sister's hand.
Slope downward, from one to the next,
Unimproved, nature's untamed quest.

The sister's house, ten years it stayed,
Until the daughter's plan was made.
Excavation, eight feet deep,
For a basement, a new home to keep.

The daughter's house, now proudly built,
Driveway paved, no land's contour spilt.
But soon, the sister's basement woes,
Flooding, where once it did not flow.

A concrete wall, three feet high,
To stop the water, the sister's cry.
The daughter's land, now stagnant and still,
Compelled to act, her right to fulfill.

The most likely result, what will it be?
A legal dispute",the sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of such surface water.,the sister must remove the wall at the daughter's expense.,the sister may leave the wall without being liable to the daughter for money damages.,"the sister may leave the wall, but she will be liable to the daughter for money damages.",C

Coastline's Soliloquy

Vast expanse of sand and sea,
Pristine shores, a sight to see.
Privately owned, a privileged few,
Claim this land, their domain true.

Acquired a tract, his dreams to cement.
A walkway there, a public way,
Beckoned all, a path to play.

Unused, forgotten, the walkway lay,
Till the man, with cunning display,
Enclosed the space, a court he made,
Claiming the land, his rights to trade.

Now, in court, he seeks to prevail,
What must he prove, to turn the tide?
His case to win, his claim to hail,
The walkway's fate, the court must decide.",Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.,Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.,Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.,"Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.",D

A tapestry rare, from days of old,
Owned by a collector, a tale untold.
A deal struck, a contract in hand,
To sell for a price, a hundred grand.

Delivery set, at the dealer's shop,
Payment due, a week's time to stop.
But alas, the tapestry, damaged in haste,
Ripped and unwoven, a sight to be faced.

The dealer, swift, rejection conveyed,
Waiting for the collector, a decision to be made.
Yet silence reigned, no response to be heard,
As the dealer, in time, a new buyer had spurred.

Sold for more, a hundred and twenty,
The collector, now, seeks damages, plenty.
For the loss he has suffered, a claim he should win,
Justice deserved, the law must step in.","$120,000, for conversion.","$108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.","$100,000, which is the contract price.","$20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.",B

A lyrical dance, a duet untold,
The singer's voice, a promise to unfold.
Yet, no binding words, no contract signed,
A tentative step, leaving both intertwined.

Expenses incurred, a production in bloom,
But the final notes, left to assume.
Negotiation's end, a failed refrain,
The producer's efforts, all for naught, in vain.

Now, a lawsuit looms, a question to ask,
What shall the producer reap from this masked task?

Or a melody lost, left echoing in the air?",Expectation damages in the form of the profits that the production would have made if it had been performed.,Reliance damages in the form of the actual expenses the producer incurred while negotiating with the singer.,Restitution for any harm done to the producer's reputation when the production was abandoned.,"Nothing, because it was not reasonable for the producer to expect to be reimbursed for expenses incurred when he knew that the singer was not obligated until there was a final, signed agreement.",D

A Murderous Bloom

A woman, wealthy in her life's embrace,
Sought freedom from her husband's gilded trace.
Desiring time with her lover's tender care,

Sealed the husband's doom, a tragic ruse.
The law now stands, a judgment to unfold,

Electrical Peril:

Toiling in the storm's wake,
A repairman's task to undertake.
Securing lines, mending broken gear,
Restoring power without any fear.

But fate had a different plan in store,
As a ladder slipped on the wet floor.
The repairman clung, his balance in doubt,
When a passerby came to lend a hand, no doubt.

Ascending the rungs, the helper's foot did slip,
Causing the ladder to jar, a perilous trip.
The transformer box, now loosened by the fall,
Sent the repairman tumbling, to the ground and all.

Injuries severe, a claim now in sight,
The pedestrian seeks justice, in the face of this plight.

A Vacant Lot, a Lifelong Friend

Permit for Protest

In the city's domain,
A rule they did proclaim:
No gathering shall exceed,
Fifty souls, it did decree.

Permit sought, a fee to pay,
Ten dollars per hour, they did say.
A maximum of fifty, the cost must stay,

Could deny any request, it seemed.

Sought the permit, as required by kind.

Denied the request, a decision so bland.

A Verse of Protest

Statues painted, a defiant call.
A student leader, a grant in hand,
Championing a cause, his stand.

Withdrawing aid, a penalty.

A Poem on Mall Protests

A shopping haven, grand and bright,
Bustling with life, a retail delight.
Yet, within its walls, a voice doth rise,
Protesting the sale of fur, their cries.

Peaceful and resolute, they take a stand,
Bearing signs, their message at hand.
But the mall, quick to act, denies their plea,
Banishing them, silencing their plea.

Now, they seek justice, their rights in tow,
Challenging the mall, their hopes aglow.
Should the protesters prevail, the question stands,
Balancing free speech and commerce's demands.","No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.","No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.","Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.","Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.",A

Elevator's ascent, a story unfolds,
An elderly woman, her tale untold.
On the twelfth floor, her home she departs,
Unaware of the drama soon to start.

The elevator stops, a man enters in,
Cigar in hand, a smoker's sin.
Defiant he stands, in front of the dame,
Ignoring the sign, his actions to blame.

The woman taps his shoulder, a polite plea,
""Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting it out, see?""
But the man's response, a heavy inhale,
Blowing smoke in her face, leaving her pale.

As the elevator stops, the man departs with glee,
What's the legal outcome, who will prevail, we'll see?
A civil suit for battery, the woman may claim,
But who will the court find, the","The woman, because the smoke touched her face.","The woman, because she had a reasonable basis for fearing that the man would attack her.","The man, because he did not touch the woman.","The man, because his conduct was annoying but did not inflict any bodily injury on the woman.",A

The darkness of guilt, a shadow so stark,
When does it lift, leaving no trace, no mark?
In which moments, the defendant's actions so true,
Absolved from the weight of homicide's hue?","A defendant came into a bar looking for a fight. He walked up to a victim, tapped him on the shoulder and said, ""You bother me. Get out of here. "" The victim ignored him, and the defendant proceeded to punch the victim in the face and stab him in the arm with a knife. The victim thereupon took out a knife that had been concealed in his pocket and stabbed the defendant in the right arm. The defendant, fearful that the victim would stab him in the heart, took out a gun and shot the victim to death.","A defendant was home in bed with a fever one night, and all the lights in his house were off. A victim, who was scouting the neighborhood that night for a house to burglarize, broke into the defendant's house through the basement window and went upstairs to the bedrooms to look for jewelry. The defendant, who was not aware that someone else was in the house, was startled when he saw the victim walk past his room toward the stairs leading to the outside doorway. The defendant pulled out a pistol from under his pillow when he saw the victim and shot him to death.","A defendant started a joke about the victim's brother. When word got to the victim about the defendant's joke, the victim became incensed. He rushed to the defendant's home, broke open the door and found the defendant preparing dinner in the kitchen. He immediately said, ""I'm going to kill you. "" The defendant knew that the victim had been convicted of attempted murder several years ago, and he cringed when the victim took out a gun and pointed it at him. The defendant could have easily darted for the open front door and evaded the victim but, instead, he suddenly pulled a knife from the kitchen wall, lunged at the victim, and stabbed him to death. Unknown to the defendant, the victim's gun was not loaded.","A defendant was a reporter for a newspaper and was sent on assignment to another state to cover the story of a mining disaster. He was sitting in his hotel room one evening, trying to get a message to his editor, when a victim knocked at the door. The defendant opened the door, and the victim announced a robbery. The defendant took a lamp from the night table and threw it at the victim. The victim was momentarily stunned, and the defendant then pulled a gun out of his own suitcase and shot the victim to death.",C

In days of old, a tract of land,
Eighty acres, in a rural band,
Held a mansion, exquisite and grand,
Built by a wealthy, industrious hand.

Yet, the nearby town, in decline's embrace,
Struggled to find its economic pace,
Until corporations came to grace,
Bringing prosperity to the place.

The attorney, seizing the real estate boom,
Divided the tract, a new plat to resume,
Lots, one sixty, for buyers to consume,
With covenants, to maintain a home's bloom.

But the county, with eminent domain's might,
Purchased thirty lots, without plight,
To build their pest-control office, in plain sight,
Disregarding the covenants, in their might.

Now the other lot owners, in protest and plea,
Seek to halt the county's plan, or",the power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.,the purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.,the abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.,restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.,C

The Law Student's Plight

A promise of employment, a path anew.

Here is the poem:

Tracts of land, a farmer's pride,
Two farms, east and west did reside.
A deed, a son, a mortgage true,
Recorded, but the future, who knew?

Years passed, the son sold with haste,
The investor's warranty, no trace.
Subdivided, the western part,
Sold to a developer, a new start.

But the mortgage, it did remain,
Unmentioned, a hidden chain.
The developer, unable to rezone,
Sold to a florist, a fresh new tone.

A Landowner's Tale

A tract of land, three acres wide,
Purchased in 2005, with pride.
A loan from the bank, a hundred grand,
Secured by a mortgage, a binding band.

The land was then split, into three lots,
Sold to friends and kin, without a thought.
Deeds were made, with no mortgage in sight,
Unaware of the bank's rightful might.

Financial troubles soon came to pass,
Mortgage payments missed, a sinking mass.
The bank, now poised to foreclose, it seems,
Leaving rights and obligations, in a tangle of dreams.

Who holds the power, in this tangled affair?
The landowner, the friend, the brother, or the bank, who will dare?
The recording statute, a guiding light,
Will unravel this puzzle, and shed its insight.","The bank can foreclose only on lot 3 because ownership to that parcel is retained by the landowner, the original mortgagor.","The bank has the option of foreclosing on parcels 1, 2, or 3 because the mortgage covered the entire three-acre tract.","The bank must first foreclose on lot 3, and if the proceeds are insufficient, then the mortgagee may foreclose against lots 1 and 2 in the inverse order of their alienation.","The bank can foreclose on lot 3, but not on lots I and 2 unless the friend and the brother assumed the mortgage when they purchased their land from the landowner.",C

In the depths of a liquor store,
A heavyset man, with locks so long and red,
Committed a crime, a robbery so sore,
But the owner's words left questions unsaid.

A man was arrested, the charges now laid,
Yet the owner's testimony brought doubt to the air.
He could not identify the man, now shorn and remade,
As the one who once stood before him with fiery hair.

The prosecutor then presented six photos with care,
Claiming the fourth, the man before the shave,
Was the very one who had robbed the store with flair,
But the owner's words held a tale to save.

And determine if the owner's testimony should be heeded.",admissible as a prior identification by the witness.,admissible as past recollection recorded.,"inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.","inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.",A

Agreements forged, a pact so fair,
Negotiations sealed with utmost care.
The President, the sole decision-maker,
Sought to sell the business, a worthy taker.

A ""Letter Agreement"" set the terms in place,
Detailing the price, the down payment's embrace.
Financing terms, assets to be acquired,
A framework complete, all parties required.

Yet, the final date remained undefined,
The purchaser's down payment, a deposit assigned.
The letter spoke of a contract so true,
Formal drafting by lawyers, a step to ensue.

But before the ink could grace the page,
The seller, unbound, refused to engage.
The investor, seeking justice, took to the court,
Compelling the sale, a rightful retort.

Declared the contract complete, binding, and clean.","No, because closing date was left out and the attorneys were supposed to compose the final contract with all of the remaining details put in.","No, because this type of letter is basically a ""gentlemen's agreement"" that is not intended to be legally binding.","Yes, because a letter of intent is legally binding if it sets forth the price, describes the business and is signed by both parties.","Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.",D

Sought to shield victims from public nod.

But the courts, her claim did not yield.

The law, they deemed, lacked vital might.

Safeguarded press, as it must.

But will the Justices heed?
The state's judgment, will they review?

Widow's Will

A tale of wealth, a life well-lived,
Mary, a widow, her last words gave.
On May, the fifteenth, her will was signed,
To divide her estate, a path she paved.

Her only child, Joan, received her share,
The Salvation Army of Largo, their part.
But alas, the question lingers in the air,
How will Mary's estate truly depart?",100% to Joan.,100% to Joan if she files a timely petition requesting that the devise to the Salvation Army be avoided.,50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army.,"50% to Joan and the income from the remaining 50% to Joan for life, remainder to the Salvation Army, if Joan files a timely petition protesting the devise to the Salvation Army.",C

Balconies and Boundaries
Two buildings, one with grace,
The other, a simple space.
Covenants, amended with haste,
Prohibiting future sales, a curious taste.

Families with children, a concern,
Excluded from balcony's turn.
Existing tenants, a different fate,
Allowed to remain, a unique slate.

Sales, now controlled by the group,
Approvals required, a cautious poop.
A balcony unit, a contract in hand,
Buyers turned away, a ruling command.

Complaints filed, a fair housing plea,
Challenging the amendment, a fight to be.
Is there a violation, a case to be found?
The answer, a mystery, yet to be crowned.","No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.","No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.","Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.","Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.",D

A Snowmobile's Tragedy

A model so popular, yet speed-capped,
Manufacturer's caution, a wise pact.
Distributors heed, no modifications made,
A mountain shop, its own path, it laid.

Buyers' complaints, the speed limits decried,

A carpenter's journey, weary and long,
Homeward bound, his workday's song.

Barred from his father's estate, a burden to bear.

Verse of Contracts and Quandaries

On September's first, a promise was made,
Two hundred fountains, a hundred-dollar trade.
The offer, open till October's dawn,
A testament to business, moving on.

But time marched on, a new request arose,
The retailer sought a split, their needs to expose.
One hundred now, the rest in November's light,
A change of plans, a shifting of the site.

Yet, ere October's first, a fax did fly,
The offer rescinded, a final goodbye.
The manufacturer's decision, swift and clear,
Revoked the promise, leaving doubts to steer.

A tale of contracts, binding and undone,
A lesson in the dance that business has spun.
Where promises made can quickly fade away,
Leaving questions in the wake of each new day.","valid, because the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the September 1 offer.","valid, because there was no consideration to support an option contract.","not valid, because the retailer had 90 days in which to accept.","not valid, because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1.",D

A Leased Condo, A Broken Promise

A woman, a home, a year's lease,
A bargain struck, a chance to seize.
The owner's offer, a purchase right,
Accepted, sealed, a future bright.

Renovations made, the kitchen shone,
A testament to the deal they'd known.
But then, a twist, the owner's word,
A revocation, a promise blurred.

The woman, steadfast, her rights in hand,
Acceptance sent, a firm demand.
Yet the owner, unyielding, refused to sell,
A breach of contract, a tale to tell.

What argument, the strongest of all,
Will stand tall, the legal call?
A binding pact, a promise made,
The woman's rights, cannot be swayed.","Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.","Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.","Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.","After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.",D

The scene unfolds, a tense display,
Accident victims, traffic at bay.
One car stands out, music blasting loud,
Distracting all, a troubling cloud.

The officer speaks, a request to turn it down,
The driver complies, a silent frown.
But then a sight, a handgun revealed,
A concealed weapon, no longer concealed.

For safety's sake, the officer's call,
The driver ordered out, guns drawn by all.
Compliance sought, a threat to shoot,
Drugs found inside, a criminal pursuit.

A motion filed, a Fourth Amendment cry,
What will the court decide, a ruling to rely?
The most likely decision, a complex tale,
Will justice prevail or will it fail?","The driver was acting erratically by blasting music in the middle of an auto accident investigation, and when a gun was spotted this justified a custodial interrogation and a search of the car.","The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists.","The officer in effect overreacted to the initial purpose of the stop, and initiated an arrest procedure without probable cause to do so, and thus the drugs will be suppressed.",The drugs will be suppressed because the officer had no right to order the driver out of the car simply because a legal weapon was observed on the seat.,C

Ballad of a Broken Convertible

A new car, so sleek and bright,
Promised freedom, pure delight.
Alas, a pungent gas, it did reveal,
A problem the dealer could not heal.

The buyer, hopeful, sought repair,
The manager's promise, a newfound care.
But fate had other plans in store,
As the fumes returned, more than before.

The car, in flames, did suddenly burst,
Leaving the buyer, in anguish, immersed.
Third-degree burns, a grievous toll,
As the defect's truth, it did unfold.

Was the dealer's effort, a hollow claim?
Or should the maker bear the blame?
The buyer's quest for justice now begins,
Will the law side with him, or the firm's wins?","Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank.","Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.","No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred.","No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.",D

Spare the defendant's case?","A defendant wanted to receive the proceeds from her insurance policy on her home. After a careful examination of her policy, she decided that the best way for her to collect would be to stage a cooking accident in her own home and have the structure bum down. She decided that bacon would be the best way to do it because all of the extra grease in the pan could easily catch on fire. After cooking the bacon, the defendant left the flame on and left her home. Unbeknownst to the defendant, she left the window open and a breeze blew out the pilot. When the defendant returned home, she found that there was no fire. She was arrested and charged with attempted arson.","A defendant was dancing with his girlfriend at a local club when she collapsed in his arms.

The defendant is charged with attempted rape.","After a preliminary examination, a defendant informed a patient that she was two months pregnant.

A poem:

Social Media's Betrayal

A young woman, seeking to network,
Joined a service, her trust to bestow.
But the service, a hidden scheme,
Sold her data, her secrets to show.

Embarrassment and humiliation,
Followed the breach of her trust.
Her personal life, laid bare for all,
A violation, a breach, unjust.

The market value of her own self,
Seized and sold, without her consent.
A claim for breach, she doth allege,
Will the court her grievance portend?","Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.","Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.","No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.","No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.",D

With a deposit held, a safeguard in sway.

Coveting her wealth in his eyes.
Desperate for cash, no time to wait,

Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

A Life Extinguished

A husband stands accused, a dark act alleged,
Charged with the murder of his wife, a life thus fled.
The prosecution claims, on December seventeen,
He gave a fatal dose, a muscle relaxant's sheen.

Succinylcholine, a drug used with care,
Claimed to have caused her lungs to cease their air.
The husband's motive, they say, was clear to see,
To claim his wife's life insurance policy.

Yet, the defense calls forth the death certificate signer,
Asking if the cause was not a heart attack, far graver.
The physician denies, the cause remains unknown,
But the husband's lawyer claims a recent fabrication thrown.

The judge must now decide, as the trial unfolds,
Whether this question, this inquiry, should be upheld.","objectionable, because a party may not impeach its own witness.","objectionable, because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.","unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.","unobjectionable, because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.",C

Weary from the day's toil,
A first-class passenger, seeking to coil,
Finds respite in the sky's embrace,
Yet, a salesman's antics, a relentless pace.

Inebriation, a torment, a pain.
Ignored pleas for peace, a growing ire,
Tensions rise, a tempestuous fire.

Despite empty seats, a choice to remain,
Enduring the abuse, a burden to sustain.
Suddenly, a blow, teeth loosened, a cut,
Innocence shattered, a passenger's plight to confront.

Negligence, the airline's failure to guard,
A claim to assert, a battle to be warded.

A Tragic Twist

The State's Economic Shift

From heavy industry's reign,
To gambling's alluring gain,
The legislature's decree,
Brought casinos, hotels, and glee.

Yet, neighboring states' lure,
Enticed the casinos to endure,

And welfare costs to ebb and flow.

The Sponsorship Dilemma

A third-year law student, the rugby club's pride,
Gathered his teammates, their worries to confide.
The law school had pulled its sponsoring hand,
Leaving the club in a precarious stand.

Then came a savior, the tavern's own lord,
Offering to sponsor, a helping word.
They struck a deal, or so it seemed,
But differing views, their agreement had deemed.

The student thought the sponsor would pay it all,
Shirts, beer, transport, and equipment's call.
The owner, however, had a different take,
Shirts and beer only, his promise to make.

Now, as the first game draws near with haste,
Which legal relationship will truly be traced?
A meeting of minds, or a gap too wide?
The law must decide, where do the two sides reside?",A contract exists on the terms understood by the owner.,A contract exists on the terms understood by the student.,A contract exists on the terms that are customary for the other teams in the community.,No contract exists.,D

The Mistaken Identity

On that fateful day, a call did ring,
A voice of threat, a chilling thing.
The operator, swift to heed,
Reported to the police with speed.

A woman's line, the call was traced,
Her boyfriend, the suspect now faced.
Arrested, charged, his life in turmoil,
Embarrassment and shame, his heart to roil.

But at the trial, the truth came to light,
The operator's ID, sadly, was not right.
The boyfriend, exonerated, his name cleared,
Sought justice, his reputation revered.

In the defamation suit, the scales will sway,
The telephone operator's mistakes will have to pay.
A cautionary tale, a lesson to heed,

A contract signed, a path to trace.

Plus ten percent of the gross, they agreed to sway.

A forgotten gift, a promise to endear.

Five percent of the proceeds, a gift to endow.

A gesture of friendship, a story untold.

Magnolia's Menace

A man and a woman, neighbors they be,
Shared land, a boundary, a line unseen.
The man, with a plan, a magnolia did he bring,
Replanted it near, just ten feet from the queen.

The woman protested, the risk was too great,
Hurricanes loomed, her greenhouse in its wake.
Yet the man persisted, the tree there it stayed,
Awaiting the storm, her flowers to slay.

Years passed, the winds did howl and roar,
The magnolia fell, her greenhouse no more.
Precious blooms, valued at thousand and more,
Destroyed by the tree, the man to implore.

The woman, she claimed, the damages owed,
But the man, he moved, a verdict bestowed.
What fate shall befall, the law to unfold,
As","granted, because the woman did not produce any evidence to show that the man was negligent.","granted, because the woman's damages resulted from an act of God.","denied, because hurricanes were common in the area.","denied, because the trier of fact may still infer liability for trespass.",A

A Collector's Lament

A trove of coins, so prized and rare,
Amassed with care, beyond compare.
The offer made, a chance to seize,
But fate had other plans to please.

The retailer's chance, not to be met.

To a novice, a tale untold.

The retailer's hopes, a harsh impact.
An email sent, a desperate plea,
But alas, the coins were no longer free.

Belonged to a professor, his pride.

Mortgaged Home, Tangled Ties
A tale of debt and secured land,
A friend's loan, a promise's demand.
The man, a building's owner true,
Sought improvements, a new hue.

One year's note, a mortgage fair,

Alas, the man failed to pay on time,

A Tragic Twist of Fate

Two friends, once bound by fraternal ties,
Gathered for a party, carefree and wise.
But in a moment of reckless bravado,
A revolver's spin brought a deadly shadow.

A tale of deeds and insurance woes,

The title policy, a promise of peace,
Unaware of the tax lien's release.

To a friend, who pays with a willing hand.

In the backyard, a vision unfurled,
A pool to be built, a new world.
The homeowner, with dreams abound,
Hired a contractor, renowned.

Yet, in the depths, a task unseen,
A subcontractor, hired to glean.
The hole was dug, the plaster laid,
But troubles brewed, a price to be paid.

The electrician, called to the site,
Tasked with wiring, a crucial rite.
Yet, in the midst of sparks and light,
Disjointed wires, a costly plight.

Now, the homeowner stands, a question in hand,
Can she prevail, in this legal land?

Zoning's Grasp, a Poetic Lens

A town's decree, a barrier to dwell,
Restricting life, a tale to tell.
Singularity reigns, a narrow view,
Excluding those, whose bonds are true.

Families bound by blood or kin,
The norm enforced, a rigid din.
Diversity unwelcome, a homogenous plea,
Quality of life, a selective decree.

A resident's home, a citadel shared,
Leased to students, their bonds declared.
The law's embrace, a test of might,
Challenging zoning's exclusionary blight.

Constitutionality, a question to heed,
The ordinance's reach, a civil need.
Equality's call, a fundamental right,
Zoning's grasp, a legal plight.",The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,The zoning ordinance would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the resident's rights under the contract clause.,The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.,D

Alas, the land, a tale to be told,
A grove of oranges and a vineyard of gold.
The farmer, a keeper of the land's grace,
Bought the grove, a ten-acre space.

The vineyard, a twenty-acre tract,
Owned by a rancher, a fact intact.
A right-of-way, an easement so rare,
Granted by a predecessor, a deed to bear.

The shepherd, though, never used the way,
The right-of-way, a forgotten play.
The rancher then, to the farmer he sold,
The vineyard, its story yet untold.

The farmer, in turn, to an investor did trade,
The vineyard, a transaction duly made.
But the deed, it spoke not of the right-of-way,
A silence that now casts a shadow's sway.

A Poem of Deeds and Mortgages

In nineteen-forty, a deed conveyed
A tract of land, a man's estate.
The owner died, his will displayed,
Bequeathing all to his son's fate.

The son, in two-thousand-and-five,
Passed the land to a friend's hold.
But the deed's recording, not quite alive,
Waited till the son's death, so we're told.

The son's will, duly probated too,
Named the friend as heir, a final decree.
Yet, in two-thousand-and-eight anew,
The son had mortgaged the land, we see.

This mortgage, recorded without delay,
Claimed to be subordinate, a curious twist,
To one the son had granted, in nineteen-eighty-eight,
To a rancher, now lost","The mortgage would be invalid, because the son conveyed his interest in the property to the friend in 2005.","The mortgage would be invalid, because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.","The mortgage would be invalid, unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.","The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.",D

A plaintiff's tale untold.
Against a lawnmower's might,
Strict liability's plight.

Breach of warranty, a fire.

Poem:

On an actress's cheek, a growth did appear,
A surgeon's skill, she sought without fear.
A contract was signed, a fee of one grand,
But an oral pact, did the parties demand.

During the surgery, a new growth was found,
The surgeon, its removal, with the actress did sound.
Five hundred more, the price she did state,
But the actress, of this, had no recollection, to date.

The surgeon, the extra fee, did seek to obtain,
But the actress, the additional cost, did disdain.
Parol evidence, both sides did object to bring,
Will the surgeon's claim, the court's judgment, bring?","No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.","No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.","Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.","Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.",B

To forge a deal, a path to sway,
Negotiating a land's retreat.

Casting doubt on the man's right to bestow,

Refused to pay, the land to not own.

Beneath the glare of scrutiny,
A man's fate hangs in the balance.
Interrogated, a suspect in a child's demise,
Grasping at the threads of his Miranda rights.

Silently, he nods, refusing to sign,

Poem:

A dream, a promise, a mother's plea,
Law school graduate, a chance to be.
""The bar exam, just give it a try,""
Her mother's wish, a heartfelt cry.

A bargain struck, a deal so fair,
Two months of study, a chance to share.
""If you succeed, I'll give you more,""
A mother's love, a family's core.

Tragedy struck, the mother's gone,
The uncle's promise, a debt to be won.
""I won't pay,"" he says with a frown,
The graduate's dreams, now tumbling down.

But she persists, the bar exam passed,
A mother's legacy, a promise to last.

A pathway carved through woodland's view,
Where a boy's sled, like a bird in flight,
Glided with ease, a joyous sight.

Turned the course, left pain behind,
As the sled, now out of control,

Unaware of the path's demand,

Echoes of the Past

A tract of land, thirty acres wide,
Held a mansion, decaying with pride.
Tennis courts, stables, and a second home,
Tenants once worked the fields, now left to roam.

As the city prospered, the land took new shape,
Lots sold, the estate shrank, a new era to take.
Five acres remained, the mansion still stood,
Insured for fire's chance, a safeguard understood.

A contract was drawn, a closing date set,
But fate had other plans, a fire's dark threat.
The mansion now ashes, the sale in dispute,
The landowner's demand, the buyer's rebuttal.

If the landowner prevails, the rationale clear,
The contract's full terms, the fire's impact to bear.
The insurance payout, a just compensation,
The sale must proceed","The fact that the antebellum mansion was insured for $450,000 is irrelevant.",The landowner and the buyer each had an insurable interest in the property.,The doctrine of equitable conversion has been abolished.,The doctrine of equitable conversion requires such a result.,D

Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

A Fishy Tale

Eight hundred pounds of sushi, rare and fine,
Agreed to sell, a bargain most sublime.
But lo, a scheme so cunning and so sly,
White fish they tinted, a deception to buy.

The buyer, bound by contract, none the wiser,
While colors mixed, an agent saw the giser.
Arrest ensued, the men now in a pinch,
Arguing attempt, not far enough to clinch.

Will the court dismiss the charge, a victory claim?
Or will the law find their actions just the same?
A puzzle to ponder, a tale of deceit,
The scales of justice, will they tip and sway?","Yes, because the law of attempt requires more substantial action toward the completion of the crimes then the accused men accomplished under these facts.","Yes, because the fish would have to be delivered to the buyer and payment received from him for there to be a completed attempt.","No, because the act of purchasing the fish and taking it to seller's facility with the criminal intent to color it is sufficient proof of criminal attempt to allow the case to go to the jury.","No, because the agreement to commit criminal fraud by the two co-conspirators, combined with the act of mixing the colors, constituted sufficient proof of an attempt to commit the crime.",A

Broke into a home, a trespass to remember.

A Drunkard's Rage

A man, inebriated and bold,
Sat in the bar, his sorrows untold.
A businessman, unaware of his plight,
Sat by his side, a chance encounter in the night.

A brush, a graze, a trivial touch,
Enraged the drunkard, his words too much.
Insults and slurs, a barrage of blame,
The businessman, bewildered, could not tame.

Then, a gun drawn, a shot so loud,
The businessman, his life now shroud.
The defense, a plea for leniency,
But the law must weigh the defendant's culpability.

What crime, then, shall the court bestow?
A verdict that justice must now show.",Voluntary Manslaughter,First Degree Murder,Second Degree Murder,Involuntary Manslaughter,C

Sledding Peril

Down the snowy slope they glide,
A ten-year-old and her classmate by her side.
Hurtling towards the intersection's fray,
Danger lurking on this winter's day.

The car appears, the classmate cries,
""Fall off, my friend, avoid the demise!""
But fear grips the girl, she can't let go,
And in that moment, the sled takes a blow.

The classmate's push, a desperate plea,
Sends the girl tumbling, a broken leg to be.
The classmate, unable to escape the sled's course,
Struck by the car, their fate takes a dark turn, of course.

Now the parents seek, on their daughter's behalf,
To claim damages from the classmate's act.
Will justice be served, the scales balanced right?

Ode to a Broken Microwave

A woman's need, so dire and true,
A microwave in disrepair, what to do?
The handyman's offer, a hundred dollars to pay,
Seemed a fair price, and she did not delay.

Weeks passed by, the promise unfulfilled,
The handyman's workload, his time was filled.
To the repair store, the microwave did go,
Eighty dollars to fix, a deal not so slow.

Assumed the microwave, was theirs to soothe.

The woman's rights, she can still pursue.",The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.,The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.,The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.,The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.,B

Here is the poem:

A son's promise on his twenty-one,
To serve his country, he had begun.
His father's offer, a car so new,
If he stayed clean, his word held true.

The son replied, ""The car, order it now,
I'll keep my promise, I vow, I vow.""
The training done, the son returned,
His father's trust, he had not spurned.

But fate's cruel hand, a sudden blow,
The father passed, no car to show.
The executor, unmoved by the plea,
Denied the son his rightful plea.

A fight ensues, a battle to be won,
For the son to claim what was rightfully done.

The son's just claim, cannot be swayed.","succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.","succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.","not succeed, because the father's promise was only a conditional gift.","not succeed, because the father's promise was void.",A

The Electrician's Lament

But the fixtures, they failed, leaving darkness to sit.
The owner, displeased, did swiftly discharge,
Hiring another to finish the task, with a charge.

Seeking justice, a measure of recovery to demand.

Fences and Fury, a Rancher's Tale
In the remote, vast expanse,
A herd, a livelihood, a chance.
Wolves prowled, a constant threat,
The rancher's mind with worry, set.

Erected high, a barrier stood,
Charged with current, a deterring flood.
Meant to keep the beasts at bay,
A safeguard, a silent sway.

Yet, a gust, a hat astray,
A heart's fragile rhythm, led astray.
The cowboy, unaware, reached out,
A surge of power, a life cut short.

In the end, a question lingers,
Culpability, a rancher's fingers.

The law's verdict, to stand tall.","the legal cause of the cowboy's death, but not the cause-in-fact.","the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death, but not the legal cause.",the legal cause and the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.,neither the legal cause nor the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.,B

Poem:

Pennsylvania's avenue, once a two-lane road,
Now a one-way path, a burden Congress bestowed.
Members of Congress, their commute they adore,
Speeding to the Capital, leaving traffic's roar.

The city's council, their vision they had shown,
Two-lane traffic flow, a plan of their own.
But the federal statute, a new law in town,
Overrides the local, a central power's crown.

Does Congress's action truly prevail?

The Edifice's Transformation

A four-story office, once proud and tall,
Stood in downtown, in need of a call.
The investor, seeking to make it anew,
Borrowed from a friend, a sum to pursue.

A promissory note, for one year's time,
Secured by a mortgage, a financial climb.

To deliver to the friend, if the debt was not there.
And when the time came, the deed was bestowed,
The friend, now the owner, the title he showed.

But the investor, with tender in hand,
Sought to redeem, to take back his land.
A battle ensued, the court to decide,
The fate of the building, where truth would r","the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.","the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.","the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.","the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.",B

A City's Rapid Growth

Warm climate, ocean's embrace,
Drawing tourists to this place.
A businessman, with vision bold,
Seeks to reap the profits untold.

A corner lot, an exclusive plan,
A resort hotel, the grand design's span.
An architect's guidelines, a builder's call,
Anticipating six months to stand tall.

Digging deep, the ground is leveled,
Foundation laid, the site is settled.
Yet, a wall, negligently made,
Thin wood, hastily nailed and frayed.

One fateful morn, a pedestrian's stride,
A jogger's brush, the wall gives way.
Into the hole, the man does fall,
Suffering injuries, a tragic pall.

If the pedestrian seeks legal redress,
The businessman's liability, the court will assess.
The most likely result, a","recover, because the businessman is liable for permitting a dangerous condition to exist along an area of public use.","recover, under the doctrine of respondeat superior.","not recover, because the builder was an independent contractor.","not recover, because the jogger caused the pedestrian to fall into the wall.",A

A land, a cabin, once forgotten,
Neglected and left to decay.
A couple, homeless, saw the plight,
And chose to make it their way.

They toiled and worked, with care and might,
Restoring the cabin, fencing the ground.
Taxes paid, though the owner was gone,
Their efforts and time, they did abound.

But in the year two thousand came,
The owner, demanding rent to be paid.
Two years passed, the couple stood firm,
Consulting an attorney, unafraid.

The state's statute, twenty years strong,
The couple, their claim, did maintain.
In twenty-eleven, the owner sought,
To eject them, his rights to regain.

Can the couple, through adverse possession,
Prevail and claim the land as their own?
The law's guidance, the court must now weigh,","Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.","No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.","No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.","Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.",C

A Pension Denied

A state's attorney, once in power,
Convicted of bribes, his downfall tower.
Sentenced to probation, a lenient plea,
His pension secured, or so it would be.

But the state had other plans in mind,
A new law enacted, his fate unkind.
""No pension for those convicted of bribery,""
The governor decreed, a harsh reality.

The state's attorney, pension in hand,
Fought back, his attorney taking a stand.
Arguing the law was unconstitutional,
A battle for the benefits he deemed essential.

The strongest case, a matter of rights,
Protecting the pension he had in sight.
A challenge to the state, a fight to be won,

Guilty, the verdict echoes through the hall,

Here is the poem:

A patient sought relief, a growth to subdue,
A contract sealed, the doctor's fee in view.
Outpatient, anesthesia light, the work was done,
A mole revealed, the patient's consent was won.

Or so the doctor claimed, a fee to extract,
But the patient's memory, this tale did lack.
The surgery complete, the bill came due,
The patient balked, the doctor's claim untrue.

Which consideration, most crucial to the court?
The patient's rights, or the doctor's just retort?
A delicate balance, in law's wise domain,
To weigh the facts, and justice to attain.",The doctor's removal of the mole conferred a clear benefit on the patient.,The proffered oral agreement regarding payment of the additional $150 occurred after the written agreement had been signed.,The written agreement was for services rather than the sale of goods.,The proffered oral agreement regarding payment of the additional $150 concerned a new medical procedure that was unrelated to the subject matter of the prior written contract.,B

A Poetic Rendition:

In a state, a statute's decree,
Bars the independent's plea.
If one's party ties they had,
The general election they are banned.

Disaffiliation, the state's intent,
To resolve internal discords, a means to lend.
The elections chief, a staunch supporter,
Deemed it vital, to avoid voter disorder.

A man, once a Democrat, now seeks to run,
As an independent, his heart's desire has won.
But the statute's grip, denies his chance,
Barring his name, from the ballot's dance.

If he files suit, to challenge this law,
The burden of proof, now sets the stage raw.
Which standard shall guide, the court's decision,
As justice and fairness, seek their elision?",The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.,The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.,The man must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest under fundamental rights analysis.,The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.,B

An Investor's Legacy

In the Rocky Mountains, a vast domain,
The investor's interests, oil and mineral, did claim.
A hundred-acre tract, just outside the town,
Acquired in July, ninety-nineties renown.

Then, in ninety-seven, the investor's mind,
Turned to sell his ranching and oil, all combined.
A conveyance, for a dollar, the deed was signed,
To his nephew, his heirs, and assigns aligned.

But a curious clause, a twist in the tale,
If the nephew's wife, without issue, were to fail,
The chef and her heirs, would then prevail,
A twist of fate, a story to unveil.

The nephew, unaware, began his drilling quest,
Extracting oil, his profits to invest.
The chef, left in the dark, now seeks redress,","No, because the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.","No, because the nature of the nephew's estate would not be altered by the wife's death.","Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.","Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.",D

A Coaching Saga

A coach sought, a reputation shone,
Sought to turn the program's fate, a chance was shown.
The university, offering a salary grand,
Yet the coach, yearning for a higher hand.

A booster, with wealth and dreams in mind,
Promised the coach, a supplement to find.
Five thousand, per game the team would win,
The coach, enticed, a contract did sign in.

The first year, a record of wins and loss,
The booster, however, refused to pay the cost.
The university, seeking justice in the law,
Sues the booster, for the promised paw.

Will the university prevail in this deed?
The answer lies, in the law's mighty creed.","Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.","Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.","No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.","No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.",A

Crushing the victims with their might.

Limiting damages, near and far.

Paralyzed, his life's path denied.

A Poetic Exploration of Land and Covenants

In the Great Lakes' expansive embrace,
A land development company held sway,
Carving out two subdivisions with grace,
Each a realm of homes, where families may play.

The eastern and western plots, each a hundred and fifty,
Bound by covenants that ran with the land,
Restricting the use to single-family homes, steadfast and thrifty,
A promise of permanence, a developer's hand.

Yet, the land held more, a fifty-acre tract,
Sold to a country club, with provisions in tact.
A club, a golf course, a pool and more,
Granted, with the right to subdivide and restore.

But the covenants still hold, a binding decree,
Granting the developer power to reclaim, should breaches be.
The land, a",Fee simple determinable.,Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.,Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.,Easement appurtenant.,B

The Cautionary Tale

Warned, yet unheeded, the mower did beckon,
Lured the consumer to a steep hill's descent.
Heedless of notice, on the slope he did reckon,
Disaster unfurled, his life thereby spent.

Strict liability, the claim the court must weigh,
Against the defense of misuse, clear and true.
Will the law uphold the warning, the final say?
Or will the consumer's fate the court undo?

The scales of justice, the outcome they shall tell,
As the defendant's motion, the court must assess.
A lesson learned, though at a tragic cost to dwell,
The warning unread, a fatal misstep to confess.","No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.","No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.","Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.","Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.",D

The Civic Auditorium stands tall,
A stage for all to enthrall.
Rented out, day by day,
For concerts, rodeos, and plays.

A rock star graced the stage,
Filling the house, page after page.
The city charges two grand per day,
A lucrative business, some would say.

But then came a religious sect,
Seeking to rent, with no effect.
The city council, in a closed-door session,
Denied their plea, with no concession.

Amid the controversy and strife,
An ordinance was born, to stifle life.
No more religious groups, the edict proclaimed,
Leaving the city's actions widely declaimed.

Will this ordinance pass the test?
A constitutional challenge, the city must address.
The fate of the auditorium, now in the air,

A Tragic Venture

Still let the teen take the wheel once more.

A Fallen Plaster, A Tragic Tale
Reopened with pride, a supermarket fair,
Freshly painted walls, a new look to share.
Yet, beneath the surface, a danger lurked unseen,
Fragments of plaster, a hazard so keen.

The manager's warning, a beacon of care,

But a shopper, intent on her canned goods to claim,
Reached for her prize, and fate's cruel game.

Striking the shopper, a tragedy for all.

A man's quest for justice, so it seems,
Clashed with his insurance, a tangled web of dreams.
Premiums paid, a policy in hand,
Yet denied his claims, a harsh demand.

Citing warning signs, a treacherous plea.
The man, silent, his case now at stake,
As the court weighed the motion, a decision to make.

Should the court grant the motion, a final decree?

The Toxicologist's Tale

Traces of succinic acid and choline,
Detected in the victim's brain, a toxic dose.

Succinylcholine poisoning, the cause of death he chose.

His results unpublished, their reliability cast.

Moves to strike the testimony, the court must now decide.

Title in the Hands of the Investor

A tale of deeds and land untold,
A state's recording statute unfolds.
The owner, once the fee simple's own,

A Citrus Tale

Groves of orange and lemon fair,
A tale of deeds and mortgages laid bare.
The grower's wealth, a legacy to behold,
Passed to the husband, a story untold.

The bank's mortgage, unrecorded and tucked away,
Came to light, a surprise on a fateful day.
The husband's sister, a mortgage she did take,
Secured by the orange grove, a bold mistake.

Protecting those who act in good faith's guise.

A poem:

Speeding through the quiet town,
A driver's fate, a weighty crown.
The officer, with instinct keen,
Saw signs of guilt, though unseen.

The search, a gamble, bold and blind,
Uncovered treasures, left behind.
Canned peaches, stolen goods galore,
Evidence that sealed the law's harsh score.

The motion to suppress, a last resort,
Denied by the lower court, a bitter sort.
Will the higher court see the truth,
And overturn the verdict, in the end, forsooth?","Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.","Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making any search.","No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.","No, because driver being fidgety is enough for a probable cause full search of the vehicle.",A

Trapped in a web of deceit,
A heroin addict, his path to defeat.
Lured by an agent, a friend's embrace,
Pressured to fall, a desperate race.

Begged and pleaded, the addict resists,
But the weight of the world, his soul it twists.
Giving in to the agent's demand,
Arrested, the law, a heavy hand.

The addict's plight, a tale of woe,

The Contractor's Dilemma

Bids were sought, the work was planned,
A three-story building, a grand demand.
One contractor's bid, a perfect fit,
Electrical work, he did submit.

The bid was sent, the owner agreed,
A signed confirmation, the deal was sealed.
But alas, the electrician could not do the task,
The contractor's dilemma, a heavy mask.

Another electrician was hired, the cost did rise,
Eighty thousand dollars, a new surprise.
The owner refused, the original bid stood,
The contractor's labor, unpaid and unwooed.

In court, the contractor seeks his due,
The owner's obligations, he must pursue.
Will justice prevail, the scales be true?
The contractor's fate, we wait to view.","only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrifle of commercial frustration.","only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.","$75,000 only, because that was the contract price.","$80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.",C

Architect's Lament

A contract, a promise, a path to behold,
Designing a dream, a vision to unfold.
But the bottle's siren call, a shadow's embrace,
Clouding the mind, leaving a troubling trace.

The developer's trust, a condition to meet,
Abstaining from drink, a challenge to beat.
Yet the temptation persists, a relentless foe,
As the months pass by, the architect's struggle to show.

The plans take shape, the concept so grand,
But the developer's gaze, a judgment at hand.
Impressed by the work, a future bright,
Yet the architect's vice casts a lingering blight.

The final plans complete, the contract upheld,
But the developer's choice, a rejection unquelled.
The architect's claim, a breach to unveil,
Seeking justice","The alcohol use was not a material breach of contract by the architect, since it did not affect the quality of the work.",The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.,The no-alcohol term was functionally a penalty clause and therefore was unenforceable.,The no-alcohol term would be interpreted as a promise and not a condition.,B

A Shared Legacy

In the southern land where it lies,
A homestead stands, a quiet prize.
Its owner passed, his will bestowed,
To uncle and friend, a shared abode.

One stayed behind, the other roamed,
Yet the estate, the friend has owned.
Tending the land, renting a space,
Profiting from fruits he would grace.

The uncle, content, had let it be,
Uncaring of what he could not see.
Until disputes arose, a decade passed,
Demanding a share, a claim to last.

Now the court must weigh, with wisdom's sight,
Who holds the rights, who stands upright.
For the shared legacy, the law must decide,
Where the profits and rents should reside.","As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops and the rents paid by the teacher.","As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher.",The uncle is entitled to a share of the rent that the teacher paid and the profits from the best friend's crops.,The uncle is entitled to no share of any of the monies raised because the uncle's lack of contact with the best friend will be deemed a waiver.,B

The Native's Plight

In a land where voices should be heard,
A party rose, their cause was stirred.
To promote the power of Native pride,
They pledged their votes, a bond that tied.

But soon, a shift, a twist of fate,
The party purged, a new debate.
Non-Native members, cast away,
Only the Native could have their say.

With each election, their nominees won,
A stronghold formed, a battle won.
The power grew, the slate was set,
A ""Native Power"" candidate, a new bet.

Now challenges the choice, a new tide.

Delivered in stages, a plan to share.

A senator, a statesman true,
Dwelled in the capital for years anew.
September to March, his routine was set,
Staying at the hotel, a loyal bet.

The manager greeted him with a familiar rate,
Fifty dollars per night, a senatorial slate.
Payments came weekly, without a hitch,
Until one fateful day, he made a switch.

Sudden departure, without warning grim,
The manager charged, ""You owe us, not him!""
Two hundred more, plus a week's delay,
The senator refused, a battle to sway.

If the hotel sues, the answer will be clear,
How many more days must the senator fear?
The question lingers, the verdict waits,

Beneath the winter's snowy veil,
A woman's leg, broken without fail.

Where a doctor's care, her hope was born.

Requiring surgery to set them, yes.
Metal screws, he did implant with care,
Hoping her leg would soon repair.

The hospital's bill, a hefty sum,
Yet the screws' cost, it did not come.
Months passed by, but healing was slow,
The doctor's verdict, a bitter blow.

Defective screws, the culprit found,
A second surgery, her leg unbound.
Strict tort liability, her claim to be,
Against the doctor and hospital, surely.","prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.","prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.","not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.","not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.",D

A Boy's Plight

On the sidewalk, a stranger's glare,
A bald man, tattoos, a knife so rare.
""I'll fillet you like a fish,"" he sneered,

Stabbing the man, a split-second pact.

A Landlord's Lament

Alas, a lease so neatly drawn,
A contract bound, a deal foresworn.
Two tenants, three years to abide,
Until a fire did their home divide.

The building, razed, no more to stand,
The tenants freed, no more to land.
The landlord, now, in sore dismay,
Seeks rent due, for the balance to pay.

But the law, it seems, does not align,
With the landlord's claim, his heart to pine.
For no provision, writ or told,
Absolved the lease, when flames took hold.

The tenants' claim, it stands erect,
The landlord's suit, it must reject.
A lesson learned, a path now clear,
Foresight and care, the way to steer.",there was nothing in the lease regarding liability for fire.,the two tenants did not own an interest in the property.,the jurisdiction has rejected the common law view on the tenant's duty to pay rent.,the landlord did not contract to convey the property to the two tenants.,C

However, the fan arrived at the stadium after the game had started, and no tickets were available. He proceeded to sneak around the guard at the entrance gate and illegally entered the stadium. He watched the remainder of the game in the standing room only section. The fan became so enraged when the opposition took the lead in the ninth inning that he pulled out a gun from under his jacket and aimed it at the section of spectators in front of him. Before he could be subdued he had fired three shots, killing one person and severely injuring another.","A customer was in a bank filling out a deposit slip when a robber entered. The robber went to the teller's window and quietly slipped a note to the teller, demanding everything in the cash drawer. The customer, who was unaware of the robbery taking place, went to the adjoining teller's window and made his deposit. Upon obtaining his receipt, the customer suddenly collapsed and died of a heart attack. When the robber saw this, he panicked and left the bank before the teller could comply with his demand.","Two men planned to rob a luncheonette during the noontime rush. At 12:30 p. m. , as planned, one of the men entered the luncheonette and pointed a gun at the cashier, who handed over the money. The man left to meet the other man outside as he was standing guard as a lookout. As soon as the man ran out of the door, a police officer tried to grab him. The man evaded the officer for a brief moment. Thinking that the other man had double-crossed him and informed the police of their plans, he fatally shot the other man.","A man and a woman had been feuding for years. In order to show him a thing or two, the woman decided to set fire to the man's house. Before dawn one morning, the woman went to the man's house and lit a match to gasoline she had poured at the man's front door. The house caught fire and quickly spread to the man's bedroom, where the man was able to leap out of the window without injury. A police officer who was driving by saw the woman running away one block from the man's house. The police officer pulled his car up to the woman to determine if she was involved in setting the fire. Upon seeing the officer, the woman starts to flee the scene. As she is running away, the woman pulled out a revolver and started shooting indiscriminately behind her. The police officer was struck by one of the shots and was killed.",D

Funds from the state, a promise to abide.
Cancer patients, their suffering to ease,
Treated with care, the state did please.

No funds for those, who abortions did taste.

Balancing health and beliefs, a political stance.

She recounts the incident, a savage beat,
With a baseball bat, her body's defeat.

Yet, the prosecution failed to ask, with care,
If any words the victim did declare.

The farm was once hers, in fee simple's hold,
A woman's domain, her story untold.
But in '86, the city called her away,
And a man took her land, a new tale to sway.

Adverse possession, his claim he did make,
From '87 to '97, the land he did take.
A year away, to care for his kin,
But in '99, he returned, the fight to begin.

His nephew, a guardian, tended the land,
While the man was away, at his mother's command.
Back in '99, the man held his ground,
Until 2010, when the woman's claim was found.

That the adverse possessor, the rightful owner would be.

Poem:

A doctor's quest, a tale so true,
Trained in a state, yet longing for new.
Crossed the border, license in hand,
Sought to practice, in a neighboring land.

Reciprocity, the doctor thought,
Would let him work, where he'd been taught.
But alas, the state's statute did decree,
""Only local grads, shall set eyes free.""

The state's defense, a battle to address.

In this clash of laws, where freedom's the key?",The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.,The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.,The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.,The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.,B

A reason for divorce, a battle to close.

Alas, a tale of property and woe,
A widower's fate, a tale to know.
On March the first, in ninety-nine,
He devised his land, a curious design.

To his co-worker and boss, he did bequeath,
As community property, their shared estate.
Siblings they were, both unwed and true,
A single-family home, their new abode too.

But alas, in two thousand and one,
The boss's demise had just begun.
Leaving her daughter, the sole heir to claim,
A legacy fraught with discord and blame.

The daughter moved in, with a heavy heart,
Unaware of the legal tart.
The co-worker, he claimed the whole was his,
The daughter's rights, he did dismiss.

In this tale of property and strife,
What interest does the daughter have","None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.","An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.","An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.","An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.",B

A Poetic Inquiry

A seller's offer, a price to unveil,
Five hundred thousand, a tale to hail.
The lessee, with improvements galore,
Sought to purchase, to own evermore.

An option was granted, ten thousand paid,
A chance to buy, the deal was made.
The notice, in writing, a must-do task,
Delivered with care, a diligent ask.

The buyer, on August, the twenty-fifth day,
Informed the seller, ""I'll have it this way.""
The written intent, on August the twenty-ninth,
Arrived on September, the third, not on time.

The seller, on the tenth, a decision did make,
""The option has expired, the deal, we must break.""
The buyer, in court, a plea did implore,
Seeking specific performance, to right the wrong bore.","Yes, the exercise of an option is not considered to be a situation where ""time is of the essence"" of the agreement, and options are liberally enforced so that the benefit of the bargain is not unreasonably lost.","Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.","No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.","No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.",B

A Breach of Promise

A couple, wed and true,
Sought a home, their dreams to pursue.
A broker, with promises so grand,
Lured them in, a helping hand.

But alas, at closing day,
The rebate, it slipped away.
The sellers, they knew nothing at all,
Leaving the couple to take the fall.

Undeterred, they sought their day,
Subpoenaing an agent to sway.
The broker, he objected with might,
Claiming hearsay, a risky fight.

A Tale of Divided Dwelling

A home in '82, united in common,
A marriage's bonds, a decade undone.
Separation came, a distant state his home,
Yet she remained, this dwelling her own.

In '94, a son's claim arose,
Quitclaimed by the husband, a deed now exposed.
Divorce in '95, a new chapter unfurled,
She guarded the keys, her domain unfurled.

Ten years of toil, taxes and care,
Adverse possession, a burden to bear.
In 2006, a suit to quiet the title,
Her claim of fee simple, the son's hopes to revile.

If the court rules in her favor this day,
It is for her efforts, her steadfast way.

Fishing buddies, their bond ever-fed.

Built a shack, their presence firmly planned.

Twelve years gone, the shack gave way,
To a plant where fish were processed each day.
A dock for their boat, a thriving trade,
As the men their commercial empire made.

Leaving a sole heir, with land in his heart.

Diseased trees cast a somber hue.

Compels destruction, a troubling cue.

A contract sealed, a price to note.
Sixty days to reach the goal,
A ""marketable title"" to behold.

Yet, shadows loom, a mortgage unseen,
An easement mars the promised scene.

Questioning if the title can truly pose.

The Pact of Excellence

A legacy to uphold, a promise to keep,
The law school's doors open, a family to reap.
A father's words, spoken with pride and might,
""Son, excel, and reap the rewards in sight.""

Five hours a day, a commitment so true,
Rewarded with thousands, for each ""A"" anew.
The first year, a thousand for each shining grade,
The second, two-fifty, a pact that was made.

The third, a grand prize, five thousand to claim,
A legacy to honor, a family's name.
The choice now rests, the path to ascend,
Upholding the promise, a tradition to defend.","the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.","the promise would not be legally binding, since it was non-detrimental.",the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.,the promise constituted a voidable proposal.,C

A community bound by covenants, with care.
No trade or business, a single-family home,
The association's rights, to the city they roam.

Proposes a change, a massage parlor unseen.

To recover the damages, a tale yet untold.

Poem:

A man's land, a mountain's grace,
Bordering a lake, a serene space.
A fisherman dwelt, a stream his domain,
Unaware of the channel, his path to claim.

The man, with purpose, dredged a way,
A shortcut to the lake, a new display.
The fisherman, unknowing, crossed with ease,
No harm, no damage, his boat to appease.

The man, now aware, demands desist,
The fisherman, compliant, his trespass dismissed.
Yet, the man seeks damages, a trespass claim,
Judgment to be made, whose is the gain?","The fisherman, because when he used the channel he believed that it was a public waterway.","The fisherman, because he caused no damage to the man's land.","The man, but recovery is limited to nominal damages for the fisherman's intentional use of the channel.","The man, because the fisherman should have known that the waterway was not open for public use.",C

Misdemeanor Mishap

Attended a rally, football's delight.
Spirits were high, as they cheered and sang,
But nature's call, a surprise it rang.

Seeking relief, he crossed the street,
To a park, where he thought he'd be discrete.

Of the deed that did the law provoke.

Stormed his home, without warrant, they say.
In his room, they found him studying hard,
And his confession, a weighty card.

The law's grey areas, forever haunted.

Justice, a balance, delicate and unkind.","denied, because the defendant received Miranda warnings and was not compelled to incriminate himself.","denied, because the defendant volunteered the confession.","sustained, because the police lacked probable cause to search the defendant's home.","sustained, because the defendant's statement was the product of a warrantless entry of his home.",D

Necessity's call, a lifeline's plea,
When darkness encroaches, a path to be.
Faced with choices, where ethics entwine,
Which actions, if taken, will the law define?
Exculpation's grace, a defendant's shield,
When necessity's demands, the scales must yield.
In this tapestry of law and life's demands,
Which threads will the jury's wisdom command?","A defendant was marooned on a desert island, along with a victim and another sailor after their boat capsized during a violent storm at sea. The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss.","A defendant and a victim were on a hiking expedition together. They were longtime hiking buddies who had climbed many steep and precipitous mountains in the past. As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death.","A defendant, who was intoxicated, was driving his car home along a heavily traveled highway. In his inebriated condition, the defendant was swerving his vehicle across the highway. Suddenly, a school bus loaded with children made a wrong turn and headed directly into the path of the defendant's auto. In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair. The defendant's auto crushed the victim to death.","A defendant, a bank teller, was on duty when two robbers held up the bank. She was taken hostage and ordered to drive their getaway car. As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection. Afraid she would be murdered, the defendant accelerated into the path of the victim, killing him and his guide dog.",C

From furniture to collars, the shelves they bear.

A mountain home, a teacher's dream,

A bargain in this mountain land.

Offers a contract, a clever paper-maker.

But did they check his license, indeed?

Yet reckless driving had him bound.

But fate had other plans in store,

Up and down the mall I trod,
Seeking treasures, feeling calm.
Suddenly, the escalator, a cruel god,
Betrayed me, crushing my foot, a wretched harm.

A witness saw, just moments before,
The same relentless, mechanical beast.
He leaped to safety, his heart did soar,
Narrowly escaping its jaws, at least.

To uncover the truth, to seek justice's light.

The Coach's Tale

Dismissed without reason, a sudden blight.
The newspaper, with words unkind,
Labeled him unfit, his role maligned.

Praised the coach, his respect shone through.
But the newspaper, with a witness in tow,

A question of privilege, a matter to ponder,
In these situations, where do the words wander?
Confidentiality, a veil to be cast,
Shielding the exchange, a legal stance to last.
Unveil the truth, let the query unfold,
Which communications are privileged to uphold?","An attorney was a member of a seven-attorney law firm. On a busy day, three of his partners had clients waiting to see them, and all of the chairs in the office waiting room were filled. A woman had an appointment with the attorney, and the attorney came out to greet her in the crowded waiting room. As the woman saw the attorney she said, ""Am I glad to see you! I need a will made up right away, because I don't want my rotten son to get any of my money. He will just throw it away at the race track. "" The attorney replied, ""Let's go back to my office to discuss this matter. "" The attorney prepared a will for the woman.","A woman arrived at a law office for an appointment and was escorted to her attorney's office. She sat down and said to the attorney, ""You know, I pay you a large retainer every year for your valued counsel. I need some advice now. There was a fire in my house yesterday. It was minor, but I'm covered for $15,000 under my fire insurance policy. I didn't have any furniture in the room where the fire took place, but I want to put in a claim for a sofa and love seat. How should I go about it?"" The attorney refused to give her any advice.","A woman engaged an attorney to represent her in adoption proceedings. During the course of his representation, she told the attorney some very personal facts about her lifestyle that the attorney needed in order to prepare a petition for adoption. The adoption took place, but the woman never paid her agreed fee to the attorney. The attorney sued the woman to collect his fee.","A woman consulted an attorney regarding a sale of 70% of the stock of a closely held corporation in which the woman was the majority shareholder. She explained the reason for the sale and divulged the financial condition of the corporation and its prospects for the future. The attorney determined that the transaction would be complicated. Since he felt he was inexperienced in handling such a transaction, the attorney decided to decline to represent the woman. The woman nevertheless sold her stock with the assistance of another attorney.",D

Gardener's Lament

A contract's breach, a bitter part.

Agreed to pay, a hundred birds.

But the gardener, English-tongued,
Heard two hundred, his friend had sung.
Alas, that friend, now passed away,

Bars the truth, a heavy trail.

Entering the intersection, a moment of haste,

Five thousand for the businessman, a heavy cost.

A lawsuit ensues, a battle to sway.

Negligence, a shared burden to bear,
Thirty percent for the woman, seventy for the man, a fair share.

A Warehouse's Woes

A vacant space, a landlord's pride,
Leased to a tenant, a trust implied.

Moved with care, as best he can.
But the ceiling, betraying its hidden flaws,
Collapsed upon him, a tragic pause.

Chose not to act, a risky decision to win.

Ode to a Falling Chair

A pedestrian's plight,
Struck by a chair's flight,
From a window so high,
Leaving no clue, no eye.

A Dishwasher's Downfall

A buyer's delight, a new machine,
Purchased with hope, its purpose unseen.
Manufactured by a company's hand,
Installed with care, in the home did it land.

For a month, it functioned without a hitch,
Then a rattling noise, a troubling glitch.
The store assured, ""This is no cause for fear,
The sound will fade, with each cycle, it'll clear.""

Yet, a week later, a dinner party came,
The best china set, into the dishwasher's frame.
Moments passed, the rattling did not cease,
A blade broke free, shattering the elegant piece.

Now the buyer stands, a claim in her hand,
Against the company, for products strict, she will demand.
Will she prevail, in this tale of woe?
The answer","Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.","Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.","No, because the buyer was not personally injured.","No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.",A

A Poetic Perspective

Tuition's toll, a weight to bear,
The state extends a helping hand,
A tax exemption, a saving grace,
For those who choose to understand.

Rewarded with two hundred's might,
But the scales tip, as we explore,
When half-time comes, the rule's a chore.

A token of equality's tune,
Yet males, their exemption now denied,
A constitutional query arises, far and wide.

That balances the rights, so due?

As we seek justice, and not to wander.",The tax exemption would be invalidated as a denial of due process.,The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause.,The tax measure would be upheld as within the area of substantive due process.,The tax measure would be upheld as within the power of a municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.,B

Stickers and Ink: A Poetic Interplay

A Mexican-American's quest,
A write-in candidate's behest,
Seeks a turnout of Mexican might,
To claim the election's rightful light.

The campaign manager's devise,
Tear-off stickers, a strategic guise,
Aiming to aid the voters' hand,

Yet the election officials stand,
With a different view, a firm command,
Stating the statute's clear demand,
Ink-written names, a binding stand.

Challenging the state's interpretive court.
What could establish the strongest case,
To support the official's rightful place?",Voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections.,A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the writing in of votes.,"Since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner.",The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.,D

The rancher and farmer, their interests to maintain.
A mountain estate, two properties side by side,
Drainage system built, a secret kept inside.

Parcel A, the higher ground, the rancher's domain,
Parcel B, the lower land, the farmer's to claim.
Sewage flows through the hidden pipeline's way,
Across both parcels, a convenience to slay.

But in 2005, the rancher's deed did not share,
The drainage system's presence, a neglect so rare.
The farmer, unaware, took on parcel B,
Unaware of the burden, the odor now to see.

The farmer, now wronged, seeks justice to obtain,
Suing the rancher, trespass to maintain.
Whose judgment should stand, the court must decide","the rancher, because the deed to the farmer did not contain any covenants restricting the rancher's use of the land.","the rancher, because the farmer's proper cause of action would be for nuisance, rather than trespass.","the farmer, because the drainage system was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages as a matter of law.","the farmer, because the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a manner that caused harm to another.",B

Beneath the scales of justice, where does guilt reside?
Which path of crime, most surely, will the defendant's steps betide?
Is larceny the answer, the verdict to be found?
Unveil the hidden clues that lead to common ground.","A customer took his watch to a jeweler for repairs. The defendant inspected the watch and informed the customer that the watch needed a minor adjustment, which he would perform that afternoon. The customer gave the watch to the defendant and told him that he would return the following day to pick it up. As the defendant was repairing the watch, he discovered that it was an extremely valuable antique. He then substituted a less-expensive look-alike for the watch, which the customer picked up the next day.","As two defendants were walking down the street, they noticed a victim park his metallic gold sports car and enter the pool hail. When they approached the car, one of the defendants observed that the victim had left the keys in the ignition. Knowing that the victim would be hustling pool all evening, the defendants hopped into the sports car and drove off, intending to return the car later that evening.","During a craps game in the back room of a bar, the defendant lost $150 to the victim. The defendant left the bar after losing his money and returned an hour later with a gun in his possession. Honestly believing that the $150 still belonged to him, the defendant confronted the victim in the back room and demanded the return of his money. Frightened, the victim handed the money back to the defendant.","One afternoon, the defendant noticed the victim riding his racing bike in the park. The defendant, who always wanted to own a racing bike, saw his opportunity when the victim left his bike unattended to participate in a touch football game. The defendant jumped on the bike and quickly rode away. Later that evening, the defendant called the victim and demanded $200 for the return of the bike. The victim agreed to the defendant's demand. The following day, the victim paid the defendant the money, and the defendant, in turn, returned the bike.",D

The woman's dream, a tranquil space.
Cymbidium, a bloom from Japan's embrace,
Eluded her, a coveted chase.

With trust and coin, a contract was sealed,

A ban on imports, a harvest unrevealed.

A State's Lament

A parcel obtained, through power so grand,
Eminent domain, a tool at hand.
The landowner, resigned, accepted the deal,
Fair market value, a decision to seal.

Yet years passed by, fifteen in all,
The land lay dormant, no use did befall.
Until the state, in year sixteen,
Abandoned its plans, a new path to glean.

The land was sold, at auction fair,
The original owner, now filled with despair.
Arguing reversion, a superior fee,
When the intended use ceased, the land should be free.

Will the court rule, in the landowner's favor?
A decision that could the state's actions savor.
A tale of land, seized and then sold,
A question of rights, a story untold.","No, because the state also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession.","No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.","Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.","Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition.",B

The Farmland's Fate

Now slips through the landowner's hand.
Advancing age, a burden to bear,
Compels him to sell, with heart's despair.

Restricting lots, a mandate to adhere.

One parcel sold, a fresh deed it hurls.
No mention made of the prior decree,
Lots smaller by half, a betrayal to see.

Sells the last plot, a heavy heart.

The Thwarted Heist

Two men, a plan they did devise,
To breach a home and claim the prize.
But lo, a system did await,
A challenge to their criminal fate.

One man, with knowledge to impart,
Sought help from one skilled in the art.
The alarm expert, though wary of the deed,
Disclosed the means, their plan to heed.

Yet, when they reached the targeted abode,
A guardian dog their path bestrode.
Daunted by the canine's fearsome snarl,
The burglars' scheme did swiftly pall.

What now, their culpability to define?
The law's judgment, a complex design.
For each, a different path may unfurl,
As justice its tapestry does unfurl.",The two men are guilty of conspiracy.,The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.,The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.,The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.,B

In the countryside, a farmer's domain,
A tract of land, his fee-simple claim.
Yet, in eighty-six, he sought the city's charm,
Leaving his land to face unknown harm.

An adverse possessor, a man did appear,
Claiming the land, his presence to endear.
From eighty-seven to ninety-seven, he stayed,
But then, for his mother's care, he made a trade.

Returning the next year, his occupation resumed,
But the statutory period, twenty years, loomed.
The farmer, longing for the country's embrace,
Sought to reclaim his rightful place.

The judicial determination, most likely to reign,
Would be to eject the man, the land to regain.

A poem:

Wages owed or larceny's guilt?
A man's dilemma, his actions spilt.
Took money without permission's grace,
Compensating himself, a rightful place.

The law, it cries, ""Felonious theft!""
But the man, his intent, was not bereft.
Believed in good faith, his own property,
A motion to dismiss, his plea.

The court's decision, a tightrope to tread,
Balancing justice, the man's words unsaid.
Will mercy prevail, or the law hold sway?
The verdict awaits, a pivotal day.",The charges will not be dismissed because his intent becomes irrelevant when he uses force to obtain possession of property.,The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.,The charges will be dismissed because he can raise the defense of necessity and it is always lawful to take what a person needs to survive.,The charges will not be dismissed because the man's right to the money was disputed and therefore his intent is irrelevant as compared to the employer's intent and belief.,B

Tranquil waters, verdant land,
A businessman's vision, a promise grand.
Conveyed to the state, a condition in tow,
For recreation, the land to forever bestow.

But hark, the state had other plans in mind,
A small industrial park, to the corner assigned.
The businessman's heart, with anguish did swell,
""The terms are violated,"" his voice did compel.

Can the land be reclaimed, as the businessman plead?

Retiree's farm, a hundred acres wide,
Tobacco crop, his yearly pride.
Ten-acre strip, northeast it lay,
Planted in March, harvested in May.

In September, the farm did sell,
To a grower, for a hundred grand swell.
The crop was ripe, the deal was done,
But ownership, it was not won.

His rightful crop, his yearly gain.
The grower, he refused to yield,
Denying access to the field.

To harvest the crop, on that fateful day?

Stamps in hand, a business thrives,
Unaware of the law's sharp knives.
Charged with a crime, the owner stands,
Facing judgment, his fate in demand.

The judge's charge, a cause for strife,
Denies the need for ""evil-meaning"" life.
""Knowingly,"" the court simply states,
Disregarding the intent that fate awaits.

The appellate court, now to decide,
Will they uphold the conviction with pride?
Or will they see the error in the law,
And grant the owner justice without flaw?","Some statutes are written without the need to prove any particular mens rea, and this statute appears to be one of them, making the court's instructions appropriate.","Where all that is available regarding intent is the use of the word ""knowingly"", the prosecution must at least prove that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or regulations.",This is a strict liability crime that requires no proof of criminal knowledge or specific criminal intent.,The prosecution must prove that the defendant had specific knowledge of the precise provisions of the federal food stamp law and the specific actions that were prohibited.,B

Helmet's Lament

Betrayed the trust that steadfast was borne.
As he battled on the field, a hero's plight,

Medical and dental, a shared stride.
Floors filled with professionals, retail below,
A common walkway, a pathway to go.

Sold the dental building, without a fight.

Until its disrepair brought forth disdain.

Faced the millionaire's demand, a legal fray.
The outcome, a decision to come,

A Quandary in the Halls of Justice

In the dead of night, a blaze so dire,
Consumed the warehouse, a raging fire.
The insured owner, a victim it seems,
Sought coverage for the lost, burnt dreams.

The insurer, suspecting foul play,
Rejected the claim, a damning display.
The owner, seeking justice's light,
Took the case to court, a legal fight.

Barred by the court, a rule to amend.
On appeal, the question now lies,
Will the higher court see the truth in their eyes?","Yes, because Rule 404(a) is firm in not allowing for character evidence in a civil trial.","Yes, because the facts do not apply to any of the several exceptions available in a civil case.","No, because Rule 404(b) permits the use of such evidence to show relevant prior bad acts.","No, because a business owner has a constitutional right to present and admit character evidence.",A

A Gambler's Wager

A friend's vacation, a college team's plight,
A bet, a promise, a gambler's delight.
A thousand dollars, a hundred more to pay,
A clause of silence, a secret to sway.

The casino closed, a new one took its place,
The bet was placed, a chance to win the race.
The friend returned, the slip in hand to show,
But the gambler refused, a debt he would not owe.

What defense stands tall, to silence the claim?
The gambler's best hope, to avoid the shame.
A tale of wagers, a story untold,
A legal battle, where the truth will unfold.","The contract was void ab initio, because the contract could not be performed in its entirety within the span of one year.","The friend's placing the $1,000 bet at the other casino instead of at the gambler's lucky casino constituted a material breach of contract, thereby relieving the gambler of any further contractual obligations under the terms of their agreement.","While on vacation, the friend told his girlfriend about the $1,000 that he bet on the gambler's behalf.","Since the gambler's lucky casino no longer had a sports book at which to place the bet, all contractual obligations would be suspended under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.",C

A center and a quarterback, their story told.
Friendly tests of strength they'd engage,
Arm wrestling, weight lifting, at this tender age.

The center, stocky and strong, stood tall,
Challenging the quarterback, ""Hit me, that's all!""
The quarterback, lanky and lean,
Hesitant to strike, his concern was seen.

But the center persisted, ""I won't feel a thing,""
Puffing out his chest, a challenge to bring.
The quarterback cocked his fist, and with all his might,
Punched the center's chest, a fatal plight.

Gasping for air, the center fell to the floor,
Unaware of the heart defect, a burden to bear.

Tanks at fifty dollars, a deal at hand.

Requested a thousand, a hopeful glance.

A contract sealed, a thousand toasters made,
A promise made, a price to be paid.

Violating the terms, the contract is raft.

Shall the contract stand, or shall it break?

Shovel's Lament

A buyer, a tool, a fateful play,
Seeking to dig, a stump to sway.
The metal blade, the wooden haft,
Crafted with care, or so they thought.

Yet, as the buyer toiled with might,
The handle broke, a grievous plight.
Down he fell, his back in pain,
A claim of negligence, a legal chain.

The manufacturer stood their ground,
Conceding the defect, the weak-willed bound.
But argued, ""If care had been your way,
The fall, the injury, would not have swayed.""

In a land of contributory rule,
Who shall prevail, the buyer or the tool?
The answer lies, a delicate dance,
Between responsibility and circumstance.","The buyer, because the manufacturer conceded that the shovel was defective.","The buyer, because the manufactuter failed to exercise reasonable care in the production and inspection of its product.","The manufacturer, because the manufacturer did not guarantee that the shovel would never break.","The manufacturer, because the buyer's negligence in the way he used the shovel was one of the causes of his injury.",D

Ordinance in the Park

Seek a permit, the city decree,
For meetings of fifty or more, you see.
Ten dollars per hour, a maximum of fifty,
First come, first served, a policy so thrifty.

But the chief holds power to deny the request,
If traffic or peace in the park is distressed.
Or if the speech might incite violence's roar,
The permit will not be granted, that's for sure.

Sought to rally the masses, his message to expound.

The Tools They Sought

A man, a woman, and their son,
Sought their neighbor's tools, undone.
With intent to take what was claimed their own,
They broke into the house, their actions shown.

Upstairs, a watch, his prize to reveal.
While the parents, in the garage below,
Rummaged through the tools, their actions so.

A Poem on the Pet Store Owner's Dilemma

In a new town, a store did grow,
Unaware of the city's decree,
Cats and dogs, a no-go.
A law, a hurdle, for all to see.

Yet, a lifeline, a glimmer of hope,
The non-profit, a chance to thrive,
Adopt the pets, a new home to elope,
While the owner's rights, they strive.

To the court, the owner did plead,
Fourteenth Amendment, a shield to bear,
But the test, the rational basis, did exceed,
The state's interest, a burden to share.

Now, the appellate court must weigh,
The owner's case, a final say,
Will they affirm, or find a new way?
The future of the pet store, a play.","Yes, because the pet store owner was not treated differently than any other pet store owner.","Yes, because the correct test requires only that the law in question will satisfy any set of facts that could establish a rational basis for achieving legitimate government ends.","No, the pet store owner has a vested constitutional right to earn a living and that is unreasonably precluded by the law in question.","No, because this ordinance is so invidiously discriminatory that it must pass the strict scrutiny test, which it fails to do.",B

A Lover's Tragic Demise

The boyfriend, a gun collector with pride.
His passion, a baseball team he held dear,
Their loss, left him in sorrow, filled with fear.

Took a pistol, heard the resounding call.
As the gunshot rang, his lover's heart sank,
Fear gripped her, leaving no time to think.

Leaving him wounded, his life hanging, weak.

Landowners' Dispute

Adjoining estates, a tale to be told,
A man's legacy, since days of old.
The woman, a newcomer, seeks her claim,
Clashing with the stable, a source of disdain.

Manure and odors, a nuisance so foul,

Whose side will prevail, whose will it be?","The man, because the woman moved onto her property after the stable had been built.","The man, because a homeowner is entitled to make reasonable use of his property.","The woman, because the noise, coupled with the odors, substantially interfered with the use and enjoyment of her land.","The woman, because the man was negligent in permitting the manure to be left unattended.",C

In the realm of joint tenancy,

Conveyed to daughters, three at hand,

Requesting quotes to seal their fate.

To craft their offer, a price in mind.

Deeds and Disputes, a Tale of the Vine
In ninety-three, a landowner's claim,
A vineyard, his by title's fame.
Then, ninety-four, a deed did unfold,
To his son, for a thousand, a tale untold.

The son, he kept this deed unread,
Unrecorded, a secret left unsaid.
Nineteen-ninety-eight, a farmer's call,
Sought the land, a deed to enthrall.

The landowner, he obliged the deal,
A new deed, the farmer's right to steal.
The fence, it rose, the farmer's pride,
Unaware of the son's claim, a secret to hide.

Nineteen-ninety-nine, the son's plan unfurled,
Sold the deed to an investor, a new world.","In a race notice jurisdiction, the farmer, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he was the last in time to record.","In a pure race jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he purchased the property for value and recorded first in time.","In a race notice jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time.","In a pure race jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time.",C

Trapped in the stall, her heart beats fast,

Escaping his grasp, a harrowing flight.
Down the fire escape, a fall so steep,

Canceled in haste, a sudden reprieve.

Sold to others, a quick demise.

Damages sought, a matter of life.

Menacing, a frightening pace.

A businessman, lost and alone,
Unaware of the danger, he's thrown.
The hulking figure, close behind,
Singing songs, his intent unkind.

Fear grips the man's heart,
As he pleads, ""Take my part!""
Wallet tossed, a desperate plea,
The titan flees, his crime to be.

Yet at the alley's end, his fate,
Arrested, charged, his case to slate.
Will the court see his intent to right?
Or will the conviction stand, a dark night?","No, the large man's songs could have been coincidental or unthinking, he made no threats, and later could have been trying to return the wallet.","Yes, because the large man followed too closely for too long, he sang menacing songs that placed the businessman in fear, and then he took the wallet and ran in the other direction.","Yes, because one should never pick up someone else's wallet laying on the ground for any reason.","No, because the wallet was not in the immediate presence of the victim when the large man picked it up.",B

A Broken Promise

A bargain struck, a task redeemed.
The lawn to be mowed, the pay assured,
Yet trust and honor, they were blurred.

A Landlord's Tale

A building, two stories tall,
Leased to a tenant, one and all,
From December one, 'til November's end,
A covenantal agreement they did defend.

Five hundred dollars, each month to pay,
On the first, without delay,
To keep the building in good repair,
Until the lease expired, with utmost care.

Tax time, a party they did hold,
Drinks and merriment, so we're told,
But a scuffle broke out, a wall did fall,
Damage done, a costly call.

Now, the question arises, who must pay?
The tenant, or the landlord, which way?
The law, it seems, holds the answer true,
A covenant to repair, the tenant must do.",The tenant is liable for normal wear and tear under the covenant to repair.,"The tenant is liable under such a covenant for all defects, including the damage to the wall.","The tenant's covenant to repair is void as against public policy, because the landlord is under an affirmative duty to make repairs on the demised premises.",The tenant's duty to keep the premises in good repair relieves the landlord of his obligation to disclose the existence of any latent defects.,B

The Encounter on the Street

A police officer, watchful and keen,
Noticed a man, sauntering serene.
As he approached the streetlight's glow,
The officer recognized him, a parolee in tow.

""I'm the president, you dope,"" he said,
""Get out of my way, or the Secret's ahead.""
Reaching into his coat, a clenched fist he held,
The officer forced it open, and diamonds were revealed.

The police radio crackled with news of a break-in,
The jewelry store's alarm had just rung in.
Believing the man was the culprit, the officer made the arrest,
And to the station they went, the man to be processed.

After his rights were read, the man requested an attorney's call.
The officer dialed the number, and waited for the voice to sprawl.","admitted, because the man's confession was not coerced.","admitted, because the statement was not the product of interrogation.","excluded, because the officer's conduct violated the man's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.","excluded, because the officer's conduct violated the man's attorney-client privilege.",B

Ode to a Stolen Car

A tale of theft, a car unchained,
A defendant's fate, now deeply stained.
He claimed no ill intent, just marital strife,
Yet the car remained, a silent witness to his life.

A Deed of Doubt

A cattle rancher, with wealth in hand,
Acquired a tract of rural land.
In Nineteen Ninety, the deed was done,
Securing two hundred acres, under the sun.

Years passed, and the land changed hands,
A dollar exchanged, with a family's demands.
The uncle, now owner, with heirs in his wake,
But a condition unseen, a future to make.

If the uncle's wife, without issue, should die,
The personal assistant's claim would then lie.
Unaware of the oil, buried deep in the ground,
The uncle's drilling unearthed a treasure profound.

Months went by, the assistant remained in the dark,
Until the oil's sale brought a revelatory spark.
Now, a quest for justice, an accounting desired,
To uncover the wealth, the uncle acquired.

The decision",the right to remove oil is an incident of a defeasible fee simple.,the personal assistant has no interest in the 200-acre tract.,there was no showing that the uncle acted in bad faith.,the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.,A

Fraternity's Folly

A student, a junior, a criminology major,
Joined a fraternity, a prank's instigator.
Late one fateful night, after a raucous party,
They hatched a scheme, their actions quite hearty.

Kidnapping a pledge, tying him up tight,
Locked in the trunk, a harrowing sight.
Driven to the city, the pledge left to roam,
Attacked by a gang, his safety now gone.

Beaten and bruised, a broken nose he bore,
Lacerations and contusions, his body sore.
The pledge, back at school, filed a complaint with haste,
The student charged, a felony to face.

The friend, a key witness, refused to take the stand,
Cited for contempt, his silence at hand.
But the transcript of his testimony,","granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.","granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable.","denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing.","denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.",C

Farmland's Lament

In nineteen-ninety-eight, a farmer's plight,
Advancing age, a thousand acres no longer his might.
Parcels of two-fifty he did sell,
To a development company, a story to tell.

The president, a deal he did make,
Three of four parcels, a plan to undertake.
Single-family homes, the deed did bind,
Two-acre lots, a restriction in mind.

Phase one, a subdivision did arise,
The deed restrictions, homeowners did apprise.
Two years on, the last parcel was sold,
Phase two, a new plan, a story untold.

No mention of the two-acre decree,
The farmer's estate, the land had to flee.
An investor, a shopping center did propose,
Surrounding areas, commercial and industrial chose.

Now, phase one, a medical practice","the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.","the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.","the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.","the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.",A

Poem:

A woman's land, a thousand acres vast,
Half swampland, untamed, timber-clad and cast.
The other half, fit for crops to grow,
Covered in timber, a wealth to bestow.

Her brother, granted life estate, took hold,
Cleared forty acres, his actions bold.
In the swampland, he dared to tread,
Cutting sixty acres, a new path to be led.

The timber he used, to repair and build,
But the woman's rights, he has not fulfilled.
She seeks to enjoin, the timber to save,
And the profits to reclaim, from the path he paved.

Will the woman prevail, in this legal fight?
The court's decision, shall bring insight.
A tale of land, and a sibling's divide,
The outcome uncertain, as the story unfolds wide.","succeed, because a life tenant must account for permissive waste to the reversioner or remainderman.","succeed, because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no such prior use had been made.","not succeed, because a life tenant is not liable for permissive waste.","not succeed, because a life tenant has a right to make reasonable use of the land.",B

A Quandary of Rights Unresolved

Echoing through the halls of law,
A battle of justice, a weighty draw.
Women, once silenced, now dare to speak,
Claiming their rights, their dignity to seek.

The state, cloaked in sovereign veil,
Seeks to evade the law's bold detail.
Discrimination, a hostile domain,
Yet, damages and fees, the state doth disdain.

The district court, a tug-of-war,
Injunction granted, but doors closed more.
The plaintiffs, undeterred, appeal with might,
Seeking justice, their rightful fight.

What shall the higher court now decide?
Sovereign immunity, a lingering tide.
Precedents to heed, a delicate dance,
Balancing rights, a complex stance.",There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.,There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.,There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.,There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.,C

Echoes of a Crime Unfolding

Two men, shadows in the night,
Held up a liquor store's delight.
One shot, the owner's life did end,
A tragedy, a story to append.

Seeking the accomplice, come what may.

A Valedictorian's Lament

In the halls of high school fame,
A scholar's path, a leader's game.
Yet words unleashed, a storm arose,
Graphic tales, a school's repose.

Teachers and students, voices raised,
Complaints echoed, a tempest blazed.
Suspension swift, honors reclaimed,
A battle for free speech, now claimed.

To federal courts, the path they trod,
Seeking justice, a higher nod.
The ruling stood, a student's right,
But the highest court, their final rite.

Did the Supreme Court, in their might,
Uphold the relief, a student's light?
A question lingered, a verdict to bear,
The scales of justice, poised with care.","No, the school exercised its appropriate function of trying to restrict the use of vulgarity and offensive discourse in a high school setting where free speech may be limited.","Yes, despite some inconvenience to teachers and students, the immature presentation must be tolerated in deference to the need to provide platforms for free speech to students.","No, the student had no rights to free speech, especially considering the violent disruptions in the schools in recent years.","Yes, in today's society sexual images and sexual humor is so intertwined into the fabric of society that it is something that has to be tolerated in the interest of free speech.",A

A Pilot's Prank, A Girlfriend's Plight

A Cessna in the sky,
A pilot's steady hand,
His girlfriend, scared to fly,
Reluctantly, she'd stand.

The engine roared with might,
The pilot, full of glee,
Shut off the power, took flight,
Sent the plane in free.

Screamed, her fear couldn't hide,
Consumed by wild despair.

But seconds later, the jest,
The engine roared to life,

No harm, no bitter strife.

Seeks justice, a legal fight,

Inflicting emotional blight.","recover, because a reasonable person would have been distressed by the pilot's actions.","recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.","not recover, because the pilot intended his actions as a practical joke and, therefore, lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort.","not recover, because the girlfriend did not suffer any physical injury.",B

Became a stage for bitter lust.

Invaded the space, a loaded blow.

A Pianist's Dilemma

In a city's small, cramped space,
A twenty-five-year-old pianist's case,
No room for a piano to grace,
Forced to travel, a daily race.

Seeking a home where she could play,
The pianist found a place to sway,
A quaint county house, her heart's dismay,
Bid placed, but the owner away.

A friend's piano, an offer to buy,
Contingent on the county home, they'd tie,
Oral agreement sealed, no need to pry,
Yet the writing lacked that tie.

The county home, the owner declined,
The pianist's dreams, now left behind,
Her friend demands the contract's grind,
How should the court this case unwind?","The evidence is admissible, to show that the written agreement did not become a contract.","The evidence is admissible, to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.","The evidence is barred, because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.","The evidence is barred, because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.",A

Here is the question rephrased as a poem:

A Rancher's Deed

On a Texas ranch, three hundred acres wide,
A strip of twenty, to the rail was tied.
""To have and to hold, for railroad's needs,""
The rancher conveyed, his promise he keeps.

Then to his daughter, the rest he did bequeath,
Unaware of changes that life would weave.
The years passed by, the ranch grew more dear,
As town encroached, its value did appear.

The railroad ceased, its tracks did adjourn,
Yet the land's worth, did steadily turn.
Zoned for homes, a watershed to guard,
The state now claims, half the rancher's yard.

Within this tale, a question does remain,
Is the railroad owed, compensation to attain?
From the rancher's deeds, what rights do they","Yes, because if all the leased land is condemned for the full balance of the lease term, the lessee is entitled to compensation for the taking of the leasehold estate.","Yes, because the holder of an easement benefit is entitled to compensation for the value lost.","No, because by discontinuing its operation of trains, the railroad's determinable, feeterminated.","No, because the holder of an easement is not entitled to compensation when the servient tenement is extinguished by condemnation.",C

A Resident's Lament

Across the street, a house I call my own,
A lawyer's office, a thorn in my heart's throne.
Criminals, I fear, roam these streets with ease,
Their deeds dark, their presence a ceaseless breeze.

I gaze out my window, watchful and alert,
Trying to discern which souls have come to subvert.

Their presence here, my sanity to defile.

""Arrest them all, their fates to depart!""

A Cautionary Tale of Appliance Misuse

A new machine, designed with care,
Promised clean clothes, a time-saving lair.
Yet, hidden dangers lurked within,
A flaw that could lead to a tragic din.

Issued a warning, a safety bond.
Recall the machines, make things right,
Avoid the risks, avert the plight.

Left by the rancher, a city to face.

From '78 to '88, he roamed the earth's crust,

But the man returned, his tenure not done.

Shaping Storms, Quelling Fears
A woman's domain, four beach abodes,
Adorned with stars, their windows glowed.
As tempests loomed, a task arose,
The carpenter's skill, the woman chose.

A contract signed, a promise made,
Thirty days to craft, the deal was laid.
Handcrafted windows, unique in form,
The carpenter's task, a challenge to perform.

Yet fate had other plans in store,
A fire, a tragedy, the workshop tore.
The carpenter's heart, heavy with dismay,
Informed the woman, ""I cannot obey.""

The woman, resolute, her voice did sound,
""Fulfill your vow, or face the ground!""
In court, the woman's case would reign,
Specific performance, her just domain.","succeed, because the carpenter's loss of the inventory would not excuse his duty of performance.","succeed, because the beach houses would suffer severe damage in the event a hurricane struck without the storm windows having been installed.","not succeed, because the carpenter's performance would be excused by the unforeseeable act of God.","not succeed, because the carpenter's loss of inventory would render his performance impossible.",A

Cousins, joint tenants they were,
A real estate bond, a tale to share.
One cousin, a loan, a judgment note,
Securing his interest, a burden to tote.

Alas, the first cousin, departed this life,
The second, a sale, sought to end the strife.
But the mortgagee, with a claim to assert,
Sought to prevent the sale, their interest to divert.

The second cousin, a defense did prepare,
Arguing the lien, no longer had its flair.
For with the first cousin's passing, the interest did cease,
Leaving the second, the property, to hold in peace.

Will the court, this claim, now uphold?
A decision to make, the tale to unfold.

<poem>
In the land of roadways and speed,
A statute stands, a curious deed.
Radar detectors, a no-go zone,
Lest motorists evade the speed zone.

The neighboring state, a different tale,
No such regulation, a greener vale.
Congress, silent, a spectator's stance,
While one resident takes a chance.

Crossing the border, a fateful drive,
Radar in hand, his choice to thrive.
Arrested, charged, a legal strife,
Challenging the statute, a battle for life.

As the resident stands, his case to plead,
The state's prohibition, a likely need.
For the resident, the law may not bend,
A constitutional hurdle, his journey to mend.

A Used Car's Deception

A man, seeking a car, his heart aglow,
Found one on a lot, a ""used"" tag in tow.
""As is,"" the window read, a promise so bold,
But what lay beneath, a story untold.

The dealer's tag boasted a ""30-point"" check,
Assuring the man, no need to fret or vex.
Yet, when the car was put to the test,
The mechanic's verdict, a shocking request.

Severe damage, the engine block cracked,
The dealer's knowledge, a fact fully packed.
The man, now trapped, tried to make his case,
But the dealer's ""as is"" claim, a legal embrace.

Stuck with a lemon, the man took a stand,
Suing for fraud, his rights in his hand.
The company fought back, the","Yes, because the dealer withheld material information intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the condition of the car.","Yes, because the dealer has a duty to give every reason why an ""as is"" car may go bad and to list those reasons on the window.","No, because the dealer cannot be held responsible for possible damage that the used car may have developed after years of use.","No, because the dealer is absolutely protected when he sells a used car in ""as is"" condition, and where the warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code are duly waived.",A

An Indigent's Tale

A man, burdened by asthma's cruel test,
Sought refuge in a new state, hoping for rest.
Yet fate was cruel, a respiratory attack did strike,
Leaving him in need of care, his situation dire.

The private hospital, abiding by the law,
Sought county aid, a request with a flaw.
For the county's statute, a year's residency did demand,
Denying the man's access to their helping hand.

In court, the fight for justice will soon begin,
Challenging the law that keeps the indigent trapped within.
A battle for the right to healthcare, regardless of address,
A plea for compassion, to alleviate this distress.

The outcome, uncertain, hangs in the balance,
As the court must weigh the scales of justice and balance.
Will the statute's residency rule be deemed","constitutional, because the statute promotes a compelling state interest.","constitutional, because the statute is a proper exercise of state action.","constitutional, because the statute is within the state's police power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.","unconstitutional, because it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",D

Colliding with the pedestrian, an accident within.

The land once held in full,
Passed to a friend, a life's lease, a jewel.
When the owner passed, a change did behold,
The life estate's flame, its tale now told.

Asserting his right, the property to tame.
But the children of the life estate's grace,
Held an interest, a rightful place.

Is their claim enforceable, a question to ponder,

Ode to a Farmland Sold

A woman's pride, her land to guide.
A man, she thought, would seal the deal,

Or can the truth break through, its course?

Where words may bind, or turn to dust.

A moment of confusion, a simple mistake,
A jacket taken, a regret too late.
A defendant's quest for a midday meal,
An inadvertent switch, his innocence to reveal.

The black leather jacket, a familiar sight,
Placed on the rack, a moment's delight.
But alas, the wrong one, a similar guise,
Taken in haste, a misunderstanding's surprise.

He left with the jacket, unaware of his deed,
A momentary lapse, no malice indeed.
Realizing his error, he swiftly returned,
Replaced the jacket, his own jacket he earned.

The law, in its wisdom, will surely see,
This was no theft, but a mere miscue, free
From any intent to deprive or deceive,
The defendant, in this case, shall be relieved.",there was a mistake of fact.,he returned the jacket after discovering his mistake.,he lacked the requisite state of mind.,there was no fraudulent conversion.,C

A Plaintiff's Lament

In State A, a life was lost,
A wrongful death, a heavy cost.
The wife, claimed by an errant tire,
Manufactured in Europe, a deadly spire.

The parent corporation, far and wide,
Does business in State A with pride.
But the foreign subsidiary, a distant kin,
Conducts no trade, no presence within.

Yet, 2% of its tires, a meager share,
Reach State A, a tenuous flair.
Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?
A plaintiff's plea, a jurisdictional abyss.","No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.","No, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation.","Yes, because the accident did not occur in the United States.","Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.",D

Granted equal time, a noble plea.
But when the atheist's words take flight,

Unfolding with each hand.
A rancher, a son, a farmer, and more,
Ownership's path, a twist and a score.

Passed to his son, a deed he did not hide.

Acquired the deed, his plan to ignite.

Purchased the grove, with trust and delight.
But the grower, he came with a different plan,
Unaware of the buyer, a new deed in hand.

Contractual Ties, a Poem

In January's chill, a pact was made,
A supermarket and produce, a deal was laid.
Oranges, a bounty, a hundred bushels per month,
Twenty dollars each, a price to count.

The days tick by, the contract holds true,
Seventy, eighty, a hundred, the oranges accrue.
But then, a drought strikes, prices soar,
The manager seeks counsel, a demand to ensure.

Perform its duties, or let the contract fall?
The supermarket's rights, a legal test,
What outcome will reign, which choice is best?","Cancel the contract on May 1, cover immediately and then sue for damages.","Wait until the May 1 shipment; if it doesn't comply, demand adequate assurances, and not obtaining them, then sue for damages.",Wait until the end of the contract and then sue for damages.,"Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.",D

A prank that crossed the line,
A lawyer's mischief, swift and high,
Bringing consequences divine.

A Poem on Inequality and Exclusion

A county, its land by the sea,
Leased to a private company.
A golf course, a country club grand,
Membership rules, a restrictive hand.

The bylaws, approved by the state,
Allowed for a selective gate.
Latino men, the chosen few,
All others, their dreams renounced anew.

A white resident, denied his right,
Sought justice, a battle to fight.
Equality, a promise to uphold,
Yet the club's policy, a story untold.

The statement that rings true and clear,
Reflects the struggle, the pain, the fear.
Inequality, a shadow that looms,
A challenge to overcome, a future to resume.",The company will prevail because its denial of membership lacks the requisite state action.,"The plaintiff will win because even though the company is a privately owned corporation, the state has affirmatively encouraged or facilitated its discriminating acts.","The company will win, because the plaintiff lacks standing to assert the rights of discrimination against white Americans as a group.","The plaintiff will win, because denial of membership to white residents cannot be justified by a rational basis.",B

Windows of opportunity,
Negotiated with care,
A binding agreement signed,
But is it truly fair?

The retailer, diligent,
Forwarded orders with trust,
The distributor, ever-present,
Fulfilled them, a must.

Yet tensions arose,
Accusations flew,
The distributor, now wary,
Refused the next order, anew.

Will the retailer prevail,
In this contractual strife?
A question of law and justice,
Determining the fate of their trade's life.","No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.","No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.","Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.","Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.",A

A Poetic Plea for Freedom

In this land of promised dreams,
A housing tract, a community it seems.
Yet, covenants bind, restrictions decree,
Must the landscaper's freedom cease to be?

The gardener's deed, void of such chains,
Passed the land, unburdened, with no stains.
But the association, with cov'nants in hand,
Seeks to shackle the land, a lien to demand.

Shall the landscaper's liberty be denied?
Must the association's rules be his guide?
Nay, let freedom ring, let justice prevail,

A Poetic Tale of Land and Deceit

A father's will, a hundred acres wide,
Bequeathed to his daughter, a matter of pride.
But alas, the truth was not so clear,
For the land he claimed, five acres he did not own, I fear.

The daughter, trusting her father's word,
Sold the whole tract, a transaction absurd.
A buyer, unaware of the hidden lies,
Paid the price, securing the land with mortgage ties.

The farmer, the rightful owner of five,
Came forward, a threat to sue, to survive.
The daughter, quick to make amends,
Paid the price, and the farmer's claim she mends.

The buyer, defaulting on the mortgage debt,
The daughter, at her own sale, the land did beget.
But now, the buyer claims the five acres true,","lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.","lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.","win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.","win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.",B

A woman's domain, with tenants on hand.
When one left their home, a choice she did make,

Of races and genders, her wish was acquired.
But now, a decision, a truth to unfold,

The Musician's Lament

An owner, a record store in sight,
Eager to draw the crowds' delight.
A famous band, a concert near,
Their music, a siren's call to hear.

Loudspeakers, outside the window's frame,
Blaring tunes, a marketing game.
Passersby, their steps would slow,
Tempted by the music's flow.

But alas, a city law did stand,
Silencing the owner's grand demand.
""No sounds, save for the clock's chime,
Shall echo through the street's mime.""

A fine, a threat, a heavy price,
The owner's hopes, a heavy vice.
If he dares to challenge this decree,
What reasoning will the court decree?","the ordinance violates equal protection because some sounds are permitted, while others are not.","the ordinance violates the owner's rights of freedom of speech, because there is not valid interest to support the ordinance.","the ordinance violates the owner's rights of freedom of speech, because a municipality may not regulate the use of sound amplification equipment.","the ordinance violates the owner's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, because it is vague in defining unpermitted sounds.",D

The Worker's Plea

At trial, a negligence instruction was sought,
But the court's own, less favorable, was brought.

The city's excise tax,
A burden to bear,
Two hundred per year,
For the studios there.

The itinerant artists,
A hundred to pay,
To use the streets and sways,
As they draw and display.

But a credit's allowed,
For the tax that's been paid,
On the studio's upkeep,
In the city they've made.

The gallery, distant,
Sends artists to draw,
Collecting their payments,
Without city law.

The tax's legality,
The court must now weigh,
Most likely to be,
Declared unconstitutional, they'll say.","constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.","constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.","unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.","unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.",B

A Confession's Complexity

A man, a voice, a crime revealed,
Confessed, then claimed, his mind concealed.
The rights recited, but will they stand,
When hallucinations rule the land?

The scene, the body, the truth unveiled,
Yet doubts arise, the mind has failed.
Volitional powers, impaired by strife,
Can the confession be deemed, true and rife?

The court must weigh, with utmost care,
The law, the mind, the burden to bear.
A delicate balance, a decision to make,
Will the statements be suppressed, or will they break?","Yes, he was insane and could not have given a voluntary confession.","Yes, the police overreached by not having him mentally evaluated before questioning him.","No, there was no police misconduct or overreaching, and as a result the confession is voluntary.","No, a confession is admissible when accompanied by actions by the defendant that prove the truth of the statements.",C

A contract, once sealed,
A promise made, a bond to heal,
Yet, the publisher's call, a sudden plea,
Demanded a change, a price to be.

Hesitant, the owner stood,
Facing a choice, as he well understood,
To uphold the deal, or yield to the new,
A decision to make, a path to pursue.

The casebooks awaited, a hundred in all,
A deal struck, a price to install,
But now, the terms had shifted once more,
A higher cost, a burden to bear, no more.

Smoke, Strife, and Survival

A woman, a cashier, a contract in hand,
Forbidden to smoke, a rule so grand.
Six months, a diligent path she trod,
Until fate dealt a twist, a robber's nod.

Faced with a pistol, her fear did ignite,
A moment of peace, a smoke to recite.
But the restaurant's fine, a deduction she bore,
Protesting in vain, her pleas were no more.

Seeking justice, her story to be told.
In the courtroom, a battle to be won,
Where law and compassion, a dance has begun.",The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract.,The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day.,The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.,"The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant.",D

The Assemblyman's Journey
A foreign land, a voice to raise,
Challenging the path the nation takes.
A joint statement, a bold display,
Defying the powers that hold sway.

But the law, a watchful eye,
Criminalizes the citizen's cry.

Silencing those who dare to be free.

Where commerce and homes clash, it seems.
Beeson and Sloan, a contract they made,
For a shopping mall, a plan was laid.

But fate had other plans in store,
The city council, a zoning change swore.

Leaving Beeson to refuse the deal he bore.

Sloan, seeking specific performance,
Argues the buyer should bear the loss, by all means.
But Beeson, his stance, he firmly maintains,
