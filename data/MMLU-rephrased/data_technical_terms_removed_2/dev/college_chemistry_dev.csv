Which of these options about the rare earth elements is NOT correct?,The common positive electrical charge carried by the rare earth metals is 3.,Certain rare earth metal compounds tend to have many surrounding molecules or ions attached to them.,The elements from the lanthanide group react with water-based acids to release hydrogen gas.,The sizes of the atoms of the lanthanide elements get bigger as we move from left to right in the periodic table from lanthanum to lutetium.,D
"A certain amount of a chemical compound reacts with an excess of another substance. In this reaction, how many milliliters of a specific acid solution are needed to reach a balanced point?",A small amount of liquid equal to roughly one-fifth of a teaspoon.,A small amount roughly equal to two teaspoons.,"A small amount, measured as 20 milliliters.","A small amount of liquid, about two ounces.",C
"How many lines would you expect to see in the radiation pattern of a solution containing methyl radicals with carbon-13 atoms, assuming the lines are separate and distinct?",The electronic message containing information will be automatically forwarded to the next appropriate individual or group.,"Favorable environmental conditions, characterized by abundant rainfall and suitable temperatures, facilitated the cultivation and propagation of diverse plant species across the region.","Even if the natural sunlight is not directly visible, the current atmospheric conditions allow ultraviolet rays to pass through and reach the Earth's surface.",People estimate that there are around 24 different kinds or varieties of that particular thing.,A
"In the reaction where some substances are combined together, one of the starting substances behaves in what way?",A substance that has a sour taste and can cause chemical burns.,The starting point or foundation.,A substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed or altered in the process.,A chemical compound that facilitates the removal of oxygen from another substance.,D
"Which of the options shows the compounds formed by combining group-14 elements with hydrogen, arranged in order from the least heat-resistant to the most heat-resistant?","The strength of bonds between hydrogen atoms and lead is less than those between hydrogen and tin, which are less than those between hydrogen and germanium, which are less than those between hydrogen and silicon, which are less than those between hydrogen and carbon.","Certain chemical compounds containing hydrogen are more reactive than others. The reactivity increases from one compound to the next in the following order: lead-containing compound, tin-containing compound, carbon-containing compound, germanium-containing compound, silicon-containing compound.",The stability decreases as we move from methane to lead hydride.,"The molecule with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms is smaller than the molecule with one lead atom and four hydrogen atoms, which is smaller than the molecule with one germanium atom and four hydrogen atoms, which is smaller than the molecule with one tin atom and four hydrogen atoms, which is smaller than the molecule with one silicon atom and four hydrogen atoms.",A
