"A cube with 6 faces is tossed 15 times, and each face shows up a different number of times: one face never appears, another face appears once, another appears twice, another thrice, another four times, and the last face appears five times. Based on these results, what are the chances of the face that appeared twice showing up if we adjust the numbers to prevent any face from having zero chances?",The mark achieved by the student was quite poor in relation to the maximum possible score.,Each of the seven equal parts added together is one unit.,Roughly one out of every five.,"Using percentages and fractions can be confusing, so let's use a simple system based on 5 parts.",B
What image modification technique is widely used for regular pictures?,"The process involves randomly selecting and extracting a portion from an image, as well as mirroring the image horizontally.",Cut out random parts of images and flip them vertically.,Making images look like they are made up of solid blocks or patches of color.,Adding a small amount of controlled noise to a signal or image to improve its quality.,A
"Here is the rephrased question without technical terms and jargon:

You are checking written works for an important gathering about advanced computer systems. Among them, you see the following statements being made. Which ones would you consider allowing to be presented?",My approach results in fewer mistakes during practice than all earlier approaches!,My approach performs better than all previous approaches when a certain adjustment is made to reduce errors on new data.,My approach produces results that are better than all previous approaches! (Additional information: When a certain number is chosen to minimize errors during the testing process.),My approach gets a lower error rate when tested on new data than all earlier approaches! (Note: When a certain adjustment value is chosen to minimize the error rate on new data.),C
How many examples do we need in a random test set to estimate the true error rate within 1% with 95% certainty?,"Around 10 times, we see illustrations of a specific idea or concept.",There are approximately 100 instances of that situation.,People created between 100 and 500 sample cases to provide guidance.,"A large number of samples, exceeding a thousand instances, were provided.",D
"Can you tell me the major issue with the following idea: Instead of dividing the data based on whether a value is above or below a certain point, we should create separate groups for each distinct value of that factor?",The process requires too many resources and takes a long time.,Doing it that way might lead to an approach that performs poorly on both the examples it was trained on and new unseen examples.,"It would likely cause a model that performs well on the data used to create it, but performs poorly on new, unseen data.",You will likely end up with an analytical model that performs well on new data but poorly on the data used to create the model.,C
