How can we balance protecting our country's safety with adapting to shifts in the world around us?,"Issues arising from the environment, like managing natural resources and job availability, lead to exploring new areas and conducting research, which could eventually bring about new technologies that strengthen military programs.","Changes in the environment can make nations feel unsafe in various ways; for example, weakening the economy that determines military strength. So if an economy's natural resources diminish, its military's long-term capabilities also decline.

What point of view on making sure we have enough energy in the future could be called a liberal one?,"The economies of different countries are closely linked together, meaning that one country having access to enough energy depends on other countries also having enough energy. Because of this, major world powers share the same goal of keeping the system that allows trading of energy resources going and expanding it further. As long as this economic system continues, it's very unlikely that major world powers will fight over energy sources.","A lack of energy sources could cause major troubles in the worldwide system and lead to a 'new global energy setup', characterized less by open market trading practices and more by protectionist and self-interested economic policies.","The oil supply is crucial for the existing situation - a situation where wealth and authority unfairly benefit a small group of wealthy and influential individuals. Those who gain the most from the current circumstances will make sure that the energy supply continues to flow smoothly, allowing them to maintain their advantageous position globally.","A lack of energy resources will lead to an increase in conflicts between nations. Fights over energy sources, especially, could cause a breakdown in cooperation between countries, as they start competing and eventually clashing over control of major energy reserves.",A

How have authorities dealt with the dangers of multinational companies after the Cold War ended?,"Responses to crimes committed across different countries have changed as the threat to the authority and well-being of nations has grown. Criminal organizations have been mainly seen as a danger to a country's safety, to be dealt with within its borders. The established approaches for sharing information between countries have largely involved two nations working together to bring criminals who try to escape punishment to justice.","Large companies grew rapidly in the 1990s, leading countries to become more open to reducing differences between nations through aligning laws and increasing law enforcement capabilities and cooperation. The government's response to cross-border crimes has focused on targeting the individuals and groups committing the crimes, rather than the criminal businesses themselves.","The US efforts against illegal drugs have greatly affected how the government deals with the growing belief that transnational crime is a threat to national security. The approach focuses on cooperation between law enforcement agencies of different countries, as well as pressuring individual states to increase their regulations and enforcement against transnational crime.","Social expectations arose regarding reactions to tackle the threat of criminal groups and to make laws consistent, which happened alongside the ongoing worldwide fight against terrorism, where the link between terrorism and organized crime led to law enforcement using military tools and information instead of addressing the root causes that enable illegal business through a coordinated global response.",B
How might bringing together academics and policymakers in a formal way lead to issues that policymakers need to consider?,"The main context for developing security theories was a shift away from being dominated by political science, towards interaction between various academic fields such as sociology, mathematics, psychology, natural sciences, political sciences, and economics.","The changing relationship between policymakers and scholars has led think tanks to focus more on developing theories that are resistant to political influence, rather than directly advising on policies.","The field of security research has gradually become more closely associated with the study of international relationships between countries. It became one of the two main focus areas of international relations studies, with the other being the study of economic and political interactions between nations. From that point onward, the analysis of security matters primarily took place within the broader context of international relations studies.","Academic research organizations and decision-makers are closely linked nowadays. The lines between educational institutions, research groups, and policy have become blurred, leading to policy combinations at all levels.",C

How are the ideas about how society shapes our views in the common way different from the ideas about how it shapes our views in the critical way?,"Those who take a traditional view see constructivism as a way to connect rational and reflective approaches, allowing each to gain from the other's insights. On the other hand, critical thinkers argue that this approach merely repeats the divisions that define the objective methodology.","People who follow critical constructivism believe that the main advantage of social constructivism is its ability to connect logical and self-reflective ways of thinking. On the other hand, social constructivists consider this to be an unhelpful return to simplistic and rigid frameworks of analysis.","More traditional thinkers who believe reality is formed through human interactions rejected scientific approaches.

How can we explain the idea of being open-minded and favoring freedom in the best way?,"People with a liberal viewpoint tend to have a negative outlook, believing that conflicts between nations are bound to intensify. This way of thinking is widely accepted and applied in the conduct of international affairs.","Liberalism is a new way of thinking about how countries interact with each other. It is a positive approach that outlines how nations should behave towards one another, especially during times of conflict or disagreement.","An upbeat way of thinking offers guidance for an improved approach to affairs between nations, driven by the conviction that a more peaceful world is achievable. It is the prevailing mindset in the actual conduct of relationships among countries.","Liberalism is not widely accepted as a major theory in the study of relationships between countries, but it provides a set of suggestions and recommendations for nations and political groups seeking to gain influence on the global stage without being limited by traditional security models.",C

"What has been the main way of thinking about security and identifying threats after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and is this approach a suitable response?","The common approach has been to create detailed studies, to help understand the lack of opportunities and power and to encourage participation in research for peace by non-profit organizations, decision-makers, and scholars.","The approach to security taken by the United States has involved implementing temporary solutions, many of which are based on research from scholars who study peace. These solutions concentrate on maintaining peace, establishing peace, and making fundamental changes to prevent future conflicts.","The approach to security in recent years has been, to some extent, a return to simply keeping control over a potentially divided global situation, without addressing the root causes of the issues.","The most popular way of studying security matters has been an effort led by the United States, which accepts the need for different governments to work together, especially for ethical involvement and achieving peaceful changes along with reducing military power across the world.",C
How have different people disagreed about what environmental security means?,"Studying how to protect the environment is viewed as maintaining the well-being of the entire natural world, with human actions posing the main threat. However, this perspective radically changes the way we think about security, as it calls for shifting our focus from protecting national interests to safeguarding the welfare of the whole planet and its interconnected systems of living beings and their surroundings.","Protecting nature's well-being is primarily threatened by human actions, and humans can only be safeguarded if their well-being is ensured within their own communities. The motivation for taking action arises from personal and national interests.","Common issues that make people feel insecure are unlikely to overlap because not all problems affect the entire world. Not all countries contribute equally to environmental problems, nor do all countries face the same level of risk. It is unlikely that interconnected systems will effectively manage those types of security concerns.","Here is the rephrased statement without technical terms and jargon:

The ways of looking at environmental issues that focus on nature and human well-being do not challenge the established views of what needs protecting. The focus on nature shows similarity with major existing viewpoints, which typically center around protecting the nation-state.",A
How can we understand the reasons behind the lack of authority and stability in some countries?,"A long-term process of building a strong and stable government is disrupted when different groups in society engage in violent and bloody conflicts, as this goes against the establishment of a central authority that can maintain order and control over the use of force.",Comparing the lack of stability in certain governments with how European nations became established in the past is not useful today because international rules now exist to stop violence from occurring when a government tries to gain more power over its territory.,"The current process of creating a new state is limited by the short time available within the accepted global standards, one problematic rule of which is the idea of national independence. Therefore, unlike some European regions that could not finish building their state and were merged into stronger ones, fragile states will remain in an unclear, incomplete stage.","The lack of strength in some nations started when the idea of a state having total control over its own affairs was rejected, and as a result, the right for a state to exist free from interference was extended. When nations are not protected by international laws, there is a risk that their national status could be taken away and their territory could become part of another state, which threatens the process of building and strengthening that nation.",C

What physical or natural differences between males and females lead to different duties or responsibilities that each group has to fulfill for their country or government?,"Women are seen as naturally weaker, leading men to be in charge of protecting society. Women understand their physical differences and allow men to take on protective and nurturing roles for them. In exchange, women take on protective and nurturing roles for those who need it more, such as children, infants, the elderly, and the ill.","Women's personal and private matters are more significant than the expectations placed on them by those in powerful positions in politics and religion, which are predominantly controlled by men. A woman's natural ability to give birth places the considerable responsibility of reproducing a nation's population solely on her shoulders.","Here is the statement rephrased without technical terms or jargon:

Violence in wars affects everyone regardless of gender, and in modern conflicts, there is no difference in the level of danger or roles based on gender. Men are just as likely to suffer mass sexual assault (such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkan wars) as women, and women are equally likely to be forced into military service.","People's ideas about how men and women should behave are not based on biological differences, but rather on societal norms and expectations. Qualities like strength or nurturing, commonly associated with men or women respectively, are shaped by what society considers ideal, not by inherent traits. Both men and women can effectively care for children or exhibit violent and aggressive behavior. However, socially ingrained beliefs about gender roles are widespread, leading women to be more vulnerable to gender-based violence in conflicts, while men are more likely to be the perpetrators of such violence.",D

How have dangerous materials designed to harm living things impacted the safety and well-being of nations around the world?,"People from Western countries like Canada, Britain, and the United States have studied ways to turn diseases like Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and agents that can harm crops into weapons. However, in the West, biological weapons were generally seen as not very useful for military purposes. Instead, military planners focused more on nuclear and traditional weapons.","People in the Soviet Union put a lot of effort into studying how to change the genes of existing diseases to make them into weapons. However, they probably saw this as a way to defend against the powerful long-range weapons being developed by NATO countries at that time, or as a way to make it harder for enemies to recover after a nuclear war. So their work on disease weapons should be viewed as part of the ongoing tensions and conflicts during the Cold War era.","Living things or poisonous substances can be used as weapons to harm or kill, but since these things exist naturally in the world, it becomes challenging to distinguish between diseases that occur naturally and harmful actions, making it difficult to verify a state's capabilities in this area.",You can choose any of these possibilities.,D
In what ways are mothers of soldiers significant for gaining a deeper understanding of issues related to safety and protection?,"Young people joining the military is not something that just happens, but military recruiters directly aim to involve mothers in order to encourage young people to enlist.",Looking at the role of mothers with children serving in the military shows how much gender-based planning and effort is needed to create and maintain an armed force.,"Here is the statement rephrased without technical terms or jargon:

How can TNCs be viewed as something new and different?,"People who take part in illegal activities across different countries are groups that may be formed randomly or in other ways, without clearly defined roles or permanent membership, but they have a specific aim to carry out criminal acts.","Illegal activities carried out by criminal groups across national borders involve crimes committed to make a lot of money, and this money earned from unlawful means may be used to infiltrate and disrupt legal business operations.","Groups involved in illegal activities across national borders are those whose methods lead to violating local laws, for example, killing, stealing, or hiding illegal money, supported by the use of organized violence.","The words 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used in the same way, but not all crimes that cross borders will be done by a structured group, and not all structured groups will do crimes that cross borders. Trying to define criminal activity done for profit is difficult and may include individuals or businesses that sometimes do illegal activities across borders but are otherwise legitimate operations.",B
What sentence does not describe our knowledge of widespread diseases in the current world of countries and governments?,"Contagious illnesses spread across countries and, to some degree, cross social and economic differences among people.","While widespread diseases threaten a country's safety, they can also weaken overall global stability.","Akin to organized violence intended to instill fear, widespread outbreaks of disease pose a range of diverse yet interrelated dangers and vulnerabilities.",The current methods for tracking and treating contagious illnesses across different countries can successfully control the spread of widespread disease outbreaks.,D
How does a person's identity as male or female influence their understanding of what it means to belong to a particular country and their views on disagreements or fighting?,"Women, despite being overlooked in traditional writings about war and security matters, often play a role in promoting national causes. Nationalism is frequently portrayed in ways that emphasize gender and female qualities, where women represent the symbols of a nation or state.","A feeling of belonging to a nation can emerge from various common events that people go through together, such as military conflicts. The act of portraying famous individuals from the nation's history, like political figures, in a highly positive light is not distinctly skewed towards either gender, and both men and women generally play similar kinds of roles in the public sphere.","Women's roles and societal contributions are valued primarily for their ability to have children and manage the household. This emphasis on traditional feminine qualities, such as nurturing and domestic skills, shapes a national identity that praises and upholds these aspects of family life and motherhood.","Men are typically portrayed as having nurturing qualities like caring for the home and raising children, while women are associated with traits like violence, physical power, aggression, and the ability to use force.",A
How could knowledge of living things affect safety and security concerns related to gender roles after a conflict or war?,"Studies into how women have been dealt with during and after wars have shown a lack of clarity in the connection between armed forces and civilian women. While women have frequently faced violence from enemies in conflicts, they may also experience harm from their ""protectors"". This bolsters the case for having female soldiers involved in certain kinds of peacekeeping work, especially in situations after conflicts have ended.",The continuation of harmful acts towards women in a society after a conflict or war has weakened the idea that such acts are more common in societies with strong military presence. Women were as safe from harm by men before the war as they were after the war.,"People's experiences during war affected how violent they became in their families, but it varied from person to person and was not based on gender.","An examination of how women have been handled during and after wars has uncovered a lack of clarity in the connection between military forces and civilian women. While women have frequently been victims of violence from enemies in conflicts, it is also true that they may face harm from their ""defenders,"" which may actually weaken the argument made by some feminists for the ""right to fight.""",A

How can forceful methods of influencing others cause issues when used by Western nations?,Those with different goals make it difficult to apply pressure from Western powers. Their inclination towards unconventional or uneven military approaches makes it challenging to intimidate or overcome the opponent's strategy. These groups prevent forces from achieving a swift and inexpensive victory.,"Greater abilities to check and confirm things that came with new technologies and ways of communicating have made things difficult for those working in this area, allowing them to verify temporary or short-term actions and lasting or long-term ones - only the latter being considered a successful compliance. The ability to check processes has brought to light cases of non-compliance after failed attempts at persuading through pressure or threats.","Forming alliances to pressure another country through the threat of military action is the only believable way for Western democratic nations to make their opponent think the threat is real. However, past attempts to build such alliances have been very limited. Differences in opinion over the methods and coordination of the policy often lead to divisions, and as a result, countries are hesitant to use this approach.

"How is the field of study that comes after structuralism distinct, and what are the reasons for criticizing it?","The statement you provided can be rephrased as: One of the fundamental beliefs in the field of Critical Security Studies is that ideas about the world shape that world, and as a result, concepts related to security have practical impacts. This means that these ideas are influenced by the existing system, and the understanding of who or what needs protection and what needs to be protected from is shaped by the practices within that system.","Putting aside complex words, the core message emphasizes promoting an achievable spirit of democracy and a spirit of constructive critique within post-structural literary works. It is this goal we should pursue, but it can only be realized under the conditions of genuine democracy.","Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon without changing the meaning: A key idea in critique is to explain what it means to be critical. This naturally raises the question of uncovering the purpose behind statements of knowledge with the goal of changing society, which is considered the aim of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform whose interests the knowledge statements serve.","The approach that challenges widespread assumptions and methods for making claims about knowledge has faced opposition from the critical studies community, as it is seen as having little to offer in understanding how knowledge is formed.",A
What is the view or perspective on capitalism according to the HM way of thinking?,"The statement views the economic system of capitalism as creating a lot of instability and lack of power for workers, as capitalists take away the ability of workers to control their work and what they produce.","People who believe in freedom and those who take a practical view of things are wrong to claim that the economic system based on private ownership is separate from politics, as this notion benefits the wealthy people who have power but were not elected.",HM sees the wealthy person's collection of excess value as a side effect of work that unfairly takes advantage of the workers who initially created that value.,You can choose any of the available choices.,D
How would you describe Booth's view on constructivism and post-structuralism within the field of Critical Security Studies?,"Examining different viewpoints does not offer a foundation for taking action, as it combines false boldness, believing everything is subjective, and intentional confusion, whereas constructing an understanding is an approach to global affairs rather than a distinct political concept.","Constructivism provides some specific political ideas that could apply to the field of Critical Security Studies, but these ideas lack the stability and long-lasting quality needed in security studies. Similarly, post-structuralist theories also lack the lasting power desired by scholars in the field of Critical Security Studies.","Post-structuralism and constructivism are vaguely defined ideas that are more like political viewpoints, which can be applied in a broad sense but lack the depth and substance needed by researchers in modern security studies.","Putting together various extreme and arbitrary political beliefs is too risky. Looking at global politics through a post-structuralist lens is more of a general approach rather than a precise, practical political philosophy.",A

What are the steps involved in grouping assets and selling them as new securities?,"When an issue that was not previously considered a political matter starts being treated as one and handled within the political system, it becomes a matter of public policy requiring government action, decision-making, resource allocation, and even community governance.",Someone can argue that an issue should be treated as a threat to security even when it is not currently being discussed in politics. A serious danger can be brought to the government's attention even when the public is not talking about it. Recognizing the threat before it becomes a political issue is the act of treating it as a security matter.,"The change of issues from a highly debated and controversial state to a position of extreme importance, where they are treated as being beyond normal political decision-making processes, is referred to as the act of making them a crucial matter of security. Once elevated to this level of significance, they cannot be brought back to routine public discussions, as they have been transformed into matters of vital national concern, surpassing typical procedures.","A matter can be portrayed as a security concern when it shifts from being a politicized issue to a securitized one. During this process, the actor(s) involved use language and rhetoric to convince an audience that the issue in question is urgent and important, and that it presents a grave threat to a certain subject or object of interest.",D

How does the way we communicate influence the act of making something a security issue?,"By expressing a problem using the wording of safety, that problem moves from the debatable political area to the security area.","The speech done by an authority figure is the final stage of the process of presenting an issue as an extreme danger; at this point, the seriousness of the threat is confirmed, and the authority is given permission to take extraordinary actions to deal with the threat.","Describing a situation as posing a danger to something important is considered a way of speaking. The process of portraying it as a threat, through this way of speaking, is referred to as creating a sense of danger through discourse.","People communicating can present a concern as something dangerous.

Is there an issue or problem with the constructivism approach that is not commonly discussed or considered valid?,People who favor constructivism cannot use scientific testing or experiments to validate their way of thinking.,The reasoned principles behind the theory that views knowledge as actively built rather than passively received creates challenges in putting its ideas into practice within a constantly evolving global environment.,"In viewing the country as the key player, the idea of things becoming more interconnected worldwide is overlooked.","Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: Even though those who believe things are constructed deny the idea of cause and effect, they just replace the physical driving force with thoughts.",B
How can we describe or understand what terrorism means?,"An act that threatens or uses planned violent actions to accomplish goals related to government policies and systems. This may involve hostage situations and planned violent activities for financial benefit, carried out by groups or individuals.","Clear planning is crucial for a successful effort to achieve the desired political aims. An act of violence that causes terror targets not only the direct victims but also a wider audience, and is seen as a tactic used by those with limited power.","People who commit violent acts to cause terror use psychological tactics to create fear in a targeted group of people by attacking members of that group. They choose victims at random from different sections of society, such as political figures, security personnel, civilians, or law enforcement. These random violent acts contribute to feelings of insecurity and instability within that society.","People who cause violence and destruction often do so to achieve political goals. This can involve governments attacking or being attacked, and the use of fear tactics by both sides in conflicts.",B
How does the view that societies create their own realities explain the way a place becomes focused on military activities?,"Seeing security as an idea shaped by society, those who believe in constructivism argue that the increase in military presence and weapons results from decisions made by governments based on the common values and cultural norms that shape their understanding of what poses a security risk. As a result, different governments will identify different threats and respond differently.","Those who believe that social factors shape reality tend to study the general population rather than the military, and they view the process of militarization primarily in terms of how it affects the safety and well-being of people.","When many people agree that an issue is clearly a serious danger, it is then treated as something that requires military action.","Scholars who prioritize human well-being and take a human-focused view of security studies believe that increasing military presence is harmful to achieving broader security objectives, and they actively promote reducing the military's role in the security system.",A
Which of these choices best explains the method used to study the safety and security of different areas or industries?,"The statement rephrased without technical terms or jargon is: HM concurs that security can be approached by dividing it into different areas or categories, and acknowledges the comprehensive understanding that such a method allows.","The author disagrees with Buzan and others' idea of analyzing security through different sectors, arguing that the approach of considering something as a security issue comes from a state-focused perspective.","People's security is interconnected, so being secure in one area affects other areas; the scholar rejects the idea of totally separate types of security, and instead views security broadly, with national and worldwide social status playing an important role.","HM prefers the method of analyzing security based on different areas or sectors, specifically focusing on the state as the main entity to be secured and drawing most of its theoretical foundations from the principles emphasizing state power and national interests that form the basis of this sectoral method.",C
How significant was the study of conflicts and ways to resolve them during the 1980s?,"Peace studies brought together various fields of knowledge and focused on practical policy goals, being answerable to the major political authorities of the time.","In comparison to academic international relations studies, the field of peace research faced significant pressure to address pressing concerns, with a strong expectation to provide practical policy solutions promptly.","There was a disconnect from policy-making, but the study of European security gained importance in the public eye due to security matters becoming political debates during the era influenced by the peace movement.",The situation was shaped by political ideas as the main area of focus and was separate from new ideas in other fields.,C

How did the study of strategic decision-making and discouraging threats influence the advancement of security-related research during its most prosperous period?,"The ideas of deterring rivals and analyzing strategic decision-making became very popular in academic circles and gained political significance because the nature of the subject matter allowed for a high level of theoretical speculation, which was accompanied by a sense of pessimism about technology that encouraged a critical mindset.","The ongoing research efforts led to ideas that created their own imaginary world of concepts like the ability to launch a massive retaliatory attack after being attacked, using threats to deter actions against allies, and the capability to control the levels of escalation in a conflict.",Game plans and prevention ideas led to a trade-off between practical usefulness and complex theoretical concepts.,"Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon without changing the meaning:

None of the previous options apply. The idea that building up weapons prevents attacks was misleading. Developing more and more nuclear weapons focused on striking first was driven by the desire to maximize destructive power. The official explanations hid the true goal behind this buildup.",B
How might changes in the world's security situation influence the types of conflicts that arise in this century?,"People will move to different places due to unfair sharing of control, money, and resources across the world. Groups without power will fight and use violence, leading to people crossing borders; and threats to the environment and lack of resources will cause conflicts.","People and countries depending on each other economically will make the world more secure and lead to fewer conflicts between nations. The movement of people across borders will result in overpopulation and a lack of resources, but this issue will be solved by advancements in technology in countries where most of these people will migrate.","The main reason for disagreements, both between countries and within them, will stem from differences in beliefs and values between groups of people as limited resources, more people, and human movement bring diverse communities into closer proximity.","Worries about nature will take a back seat to threats caused by worldwide money troubles and the growth of extreme beliefs and brutality. People movement will be controlled within the current setup of how money works globally because being poor limits movement, though there is a small risk of revolt across nations due to lack of power and scarce resources.",A
Is the situation where weak states feel threatened and seek to strengthen their defenses an unavoidable circumstance?,"The worldwide campaign against violent extremist groups has had a beneficial impact on the efforts to establish stable governing systems. The battle against terrorism has shifted global focus and resources towards eliminating sources of instability, acknowledging the various factors that contribute to the rise of terrorism. This includes regulating the spread of weapons.","Many countries with unstable governments and safety issues have not received enough attention globally, and the proposed solutions have only focused on establishing democratic systems with free markets. However, attempting to forcibly impose such economic and political models, whether through requirements, overthrowing governments, or post-conflict rebuilding efforts, has not successfully transformed any unstable country into a stable one.","The inability of traditional government reforms to work has shown that other ways of organizing political systems beyond nations may become more possible. Organizations below the national level are a realistic way to address areas with ongoing issues of weapons and poverty, while regional organization is a long-lasting structural form in Africa and Latin America.","States with little power have started a long and challenging journey to become strong and capable. To address the most concerning issues, they have implemented lasting security plans that involve creating multiple political parties, opening up their economies, and joining global organizations.",B

What helped lead to the creation of new ideas and practices in the study of safety and protection?,"People outside the field were needed since technology advanced, leading to a change from improving fast-changing technologies to using existing technologies.","Theory was required because nuclear power was more practical and experience-based, considered as something that would be managed by the most likely events in a conflict scenario - the strategy of discouragement.",Wider concerns about possible long-term consequences led to a change from short-term actions to long-term planning.,"To deal with the dangers of powerful weapons and political tensions at the time, a unified and robust leadership was necessary to oversee all aspects of economic, political, and military planning.",C

How has the threat of using nuclear weapons influenced relationships between countries after the Cold War ended?,"The number of scholars worrying about the spread of weapons is increasing, a pattern that has grown stronger rather than weakened after the Cold War ended. There are fears that an accidental war could happen, either through misunderstanding, psychological or technical issues that can lead to rising tensions and the failure of policies meant to prevent war. Additionally, normal mistakes resulting from a state's inability to properly predict interactions between humans and machines in the complexities of the international (and disorderly) system may also occur.","People who believe the spread of nuclear technology is not a big problem disagree with the idea that having nuclear capabilities makes countries more likely to go to war. They admit that if terrorists get nuclear weapons, it could threaten the entire world, but that hasn't happened yet. Additionally, the ability to strike back can remove any potential benefits an opponent might gain from attacking.","Even though it is understood that having the ability to strike back (the secure second-strike capability) creates a situation known as crisis stability, there is no agreement on whether nuclear capabilities are a source of stability or a threat to existence. However, there is a consensus that the spread of weapons of mass destruction capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally harmful to international security, based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed, as long as the possibility exists, states will have to increase security efforts.","States using the threat of force caused stability during the conflict between major powers, but those who worry about the spread of nuclear weapons argue that new nations developing such weapons do not give enough assurance that their leaders will be responsible guardians. Fragile governments might face sabotage, accidental use, or even theft of nuclear materials. There is also a risk that states claim to seek defensive capabilities while secretly pursuing offensive aims. Internal pressures could push a regime towards using nuclear weapons to quickly win a war and boost its standing.",C
How does the Ideal Policy approach clarify earlier insights into the required circumstances for forceful negotiation efforts to be successful?,"Western countries find it hard to keep public backing for wars that do not directly impact their crucial goals. So, rivals may see Western warnings of a drawn-out war in such cases as an empty threat. In reality, this means that the side trying to force the other must have stronger military might, deny the opponent's aims, and impose costs that directly threaten the opponent's interests.","To make a threat believable, having the necessary military power to quickly defeat the opponent is not enough. There must be a clear deadline for the opponent to comply. If no deadline is set, it will be seen as a sign that the person making the threat lacks the determination to follow through.","If there are no guarantees against further requests, the chances of accomplishing the goal will decrease. If legitimate worries exist, there will be less motivation to go along with the plan.",Make it extremely difficult for the opponent to disobey by issuing a warning about quickly overpowering them with minimal costs. The warning aims to instill fear of severe consequences and establish that the threat is genuine.,D

Every choice mentioned is possible.",D
How does the way people act relate to understanding economic safety?,"People make choices, and using the study of how people make choices for security purposes allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of countries and other security groups.",People's purchasing decisions now heavily influence the worldwide economic landscape. How people spend their money determines the dynamics of the global economic system.,"Customs and practices, when viewed from a perspective that considers them as shaped by societal influences, are not applicable to economic principles or overall theories about safety and protection.","Countries act based on what benefits their economy the most, whether it's making good trade deals with other countries or strengthening their own domestic markets. So their actions are driven by economic factors.",A
How might concerns about the environment's safety and protection change over a long period of time?,"After the 9/11 events, as the focus shifted back to more conventional security concerns, the idea of environmental threats to safety is expected to remain an important area of study for experts and decision-makers.","Growing proof that issues with the environment could harm us may increasingly impact how nations think about their own safety and act. This issue will grow in importance until individual countries take steps on their own to protect their societies, which could actually increase the chance of conflict.","Keeping the nation safe is the best way to make changes that protect the environment, which will strengthen the country's social and economic foundations against danger. On a practical level, the government is the most capable body - having control over force and resources - to make international agreements for managing environmental challenges.","Environmental issues are not expected to go away, so the importance of addressing them through policy, especially through joint efforts to find solutions that are environmentally sustainable, will likely grow. In a way, current approaches to national security can hinder the ability to ensure environmental well-being for everyone.",D
How can we ensure a reliable supply of energy sources?,The term 'energy security nexus' refers to the ever-changing relationship between the availability of energy resources and the degree of safety and stability that nations dependent on these resources can attain.,"Two countries fight over access to the same limited energy source, like an oil reserve.",There is a connection between energy supply and demand around the world because energy sources and the need for energy are not evenly distributed; this leads countries to form intricate and interdependent relationships with each other.,There is an interconnected relationship between energy resources and security because oil-rich countries strategically plan to maintain an unequal distribution of energy supply and demand across different regions.,C
"Can it be justified that local nuclear programs are making safety measures to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons ineffective, as suggested by Braun and Chyba (2004)?","Powerful weapons can help weaker nations stand up against stronger rivals with better regular weapons. Having such weapons might discourage stronger opponents from attacking, or could be used to defeat them in battle. Nations may also develop these capabilities to gain importance and influence in the world.","Even though there are worries that violent groups might get the ability to create destructive weapons, it would still be very hard for them to build even a basic nuclear bomb. However, while nuclear weapons may be out of reach, groups inside or outside a country may have the means to make and use chemical, biological, and radioactive weapons.","Deadly weapons vary greatly in terms of how easily they can be obtained, how deadly they are, how much damage they can cause, and how simple they are to produce. This means that each type of weapon poses different potential threats. Nuclear bombs that are extremely powerful yet small in size use advanced technology, while some chemical and biological weapons have been around for a long time. What sets these deadly weapons apart from conventional weapons is their ability to cause massive destruction. Due to the intense fear that possessing them can create, these deadly weapons will remain highly desirable for political leverage.",Many possibilities can be considered.,D
How would someone who studies the effects of countries gaining independence from being ruled by another describe the following ideas?,"People's ideas about different countries are influenced by the way those countries were colonized in the past, which leads to some countries being seen as less important or valuable than others.","Doing business and governing without restrictions across European nations, and having governments chosen by people through voting, are the ideal approaches for fostering a tranquil and steady worldwide situation.","After World War II ended and the British Empire slowly broke apart, many ideas related to countries gaining independence from empires are no longer relevant.",Controlling nations can only maintain authority by using armed forces to occupy other territories.,A
How did the ways of thinking about a subject differ between Europe and the Americas?,People in the United States often see security threats as coming from outside the country. There are different views on what should be considered security issues and how to define security.,The European way of education focuses on a dominant form of understanding. Understanding is seen as comprehending the reasons behind how things work in relation to the materials involved.,Diverse types of understanding relate to contrasting views on their connection to decision-making processes: the issue-resolving approach in American political analysis versus the questioning studies in Europe.,Making educated guesses involves different forms of knowledge backed by proven cause-and-effect connections.,C
States try to feel safe. What best explains how traditional studies look at why and how states work to feel safe?,"The ways in which different countries interact and make decisions are determined by how much influence and strength each country has compared to others, and how this balance of power shifts between the most powerful nations. A country's abilities and limitations shape the approach it takes to protect itself.",The old ways of thinking arose due to the conflict and rivalry between the two most powerful nations. These traditional theories aim to understand actions based on the buildup of weapons.,"People developed ideas to explain the groups of rules and ways of behaving that result in controlling conflicts and working together in global interactions, in particular areas of activity.",States have complete power and authority over their land and people.

"In simple words, what are the possibilities for using force to protect a group's sense of who they are?","When one group faces a military threat from another, especially when it involves protecting their ancestral homeland, they must respond with armed force. However, within a country's borders, many social groups lack the means for armed defense and have to resort to non-violent countermeasures.",Groups within a country that feel their way of life is threatened politically or militarily will create their own armed forces to defend themselves. This leads to the formation of unofficial territories that can weaken the power and borders of the nation.,"Since society follows the state's rules, it can quickly and undoubtedly use the state's forces (like military action) if there is a danger to society's safety.","Social groups do not face armed threats; since they are formed by shared identity and social bonds, armed forces do not take action against social groups in any significant manner.",A

How does the view that social changes are rooted in economic factors relate to the movement promoting fairness and equality across the world?,"Past philosophies focused on human conditions contradict the aims of worldwide equality movements, which support the growth of free market policies following the recent worldwide economic downturn.","Studying the relationships between human societies, their economic foundations, and their historical progress has a record of working towards fairness for all and rejecting unfair treatment; during the decades-long rivalry between major world powers with different economic systems, it formed the reasoning behind objecting to oppressive states following one of those systems.","The study of how societies evolve does not offer any special viewpoint on business and trade, and is more focused on the history of capitalist commerce than on the mistreatment or isolation of people within that system.","Looking at the development of human societies over time, the ideas cover both individual freedoms and financial opportunities. These concepts have played a significant role in movements against and providing alternative perspectives on global interconnectedness, including the Occupy demonstrations.",D
How are a nation's complete authority over its territory and outside involvement to aid people within that nation connected?,"States were allowed to govern themselves as they wished, but their actions depended on how those in power behaved; the wellbeing of people was seen as more important than blindly following rules about state power, meaning outside help could be given if needed to protect people.","Ideas about countries having complete power over their own territory say that not interfering in other nations' affairs is key for safety; this view is applied today where groups like the UN criticize armed intervention to help people, seeing it as harmful for security focused on countries themselves.",Rules about keeping a nation's control and not interfering with other nations can be put aside if there is agreement among global players that people's lives in that nation are endangered by the nation's own actions.,"Countries around the world have agreed to follow rules that say they should avoid getting involved in other countries' affairs and respect each country's right to govern itself independently, as a way to maintain peace and security. These rules are officially stated in the founding document of the United Nations, which prohibits the use of military force between countries except for self-defense or when approved by the UN.",D
How have global events and changes after the Cold War ended affected a country's ability to enforce its rules and laws?,"The growing worldwide connections in business, money, and travel have created conditions that help criminal organizations, as it is now simpler for them to move illegal money and goods, provide unlawful services, and smuggle people across country borders.",The changes in politics towards democracy and in economies towards free markets since the 1980s - which often happened at the same time in the same country - have weakened the ability of governments to enforce laws and created new opportunities for criminal groups to infiltrate societies undergoing these transitions.,People being forced to leave their homes due to wars and violence created many groups spread across different countries.

How was the Western reaction to the Arab Spring protests challenging the ideas of liberalism?,"The difficult claim that the freedom-supporting view comes from ideas rooted in Western cultures - such as elected government, open business practices, and individual liberties.","People who held liberal beliefs did not offer a straightforward approach to address the widespread protests and uprisings in the Arab world, and the flaws and conflicting ideas within that ideology became apparent.","The viewpoint that supports freedom does not make it obvious how and when this idea of freedom is meant to spread, in this instance to the Arab nations being discussed.",Everything mentioned previously,D

Why do people commit violent acts against civilians?,"Speaking understandably, the spread of democratic systems and strong national identities reduces the chances for terrorist activities: national pride helps unite different ethnic groups, while democracy allows for complaints to be addressed constructively. In this view, countries with poorly established democracies and weak national unity could create conditions that enable terrorism to emerge.","People who follow certain Islamic beliefs view themselves as superior and are against the separation of religion and state that comes with modern society. It is an interesting contrast that while these violent acts were organized around the perceived threat to Islamic communities in the Middle East, the response to this threat has made groups in Europe feel that their own cultural values are being threatened by Muslims.","The way businesses operate and advancements in technology and communication have increasingly interfered with traditional ways of life and societies. Differences in development progress and the increasing exclusion of some ethnic or economic groups within populations, combined with a growing awareness of their disadvantaged position, provide breeding grounds for acts of violence motivated by a cause.","People living under strict, controlling governments that use harsh methods may turn to violent acts intended to overthrow the political system due to widespread unhappiness. In contrast, in countries with free and fair political systems, citizens have outlets to express their dissatisfaction through legal and peaceful means, preventing them from resorting to destructive actions.",C
How should we define actions and groups commonly referred to as terrorism and terrorist threats in a reasonable and understandable way?,"Individuals willing to sacrifice their lives have carried out violent bombings, allowing them to detonate explosives at the very last moment or when causing the most harm. A concerning possibility is that such an attack could involve the use of dangerous chemical, biological, or radioactive materials.","People can more easily identify potential vulnerable targets in democratic countries because the government has restrictions on how much it can monitor its citizens, and an attack would receive widespread attention. However, security forces in weak non-democratic countries also create favorable conditions for terrorist activities by allowing relative freedom of movement and operations.","Extremely destructive weapons have rarely been used as they require lots of money and skilled people to operate. Additionally, most violent groups prefer to use more reliable methods to cause as many deaths as possible. However, these violent groups have gained some advantage through the fear created by the potential use of such weapons.",You may select any or all of the available choices.,D

Why is it important to understand the reasons and effects of lack of safety in poorer countries?,"With real-world evidence, there is a necessity to comprehend the reason why almost all military conflicts and significant political violence after 1945 continues to happen in less developed nations, and why most of it arises from internal rather than external sources. Between 20 to 30 million people have lost their lives in more than one hundred wars within nations, and there are 20 to 40 ongoing wars in any given year.","There is a requirement to identify suitable ideas and principles that address the distinct nature of security challenges faced by developing nations, such as internal conflicts, violence among communities, lack of resources, spread of weapons, criminal activities, political unrest, socio-economic decline, and the failure of governing systems.","Looking from a moral point of view, there are obvious reasons to address the lack of safety; 90 percent of those harmed by violence within a country are ordinary people, half a million lose their lives due to small arms, 40,000 die yearly from lack of food and resources, while tens of millions succumb to illness, chronic lack of basic necessities, poor healthcare, education, employment opportunities, and environmental factors.","Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: All of these choices apply. There is a big difference between safety in wealthy countries and the lack of safety in unstable parts of the world. Looking at the whole world, a lack of safety is more common than safety. However, as our world becomes more connected, these unsafe situations cannot be kept within national borders.",D
Which of the following statements about the start of conflict is correct when looking at the relationships between countries from a practical viewpoint?,"When a nation's strength and ability to defend itself from threats diminish, it becomes more inclined to act aggressively or engage in conflicts.","In a world with multiple major powers, countries might be more prone to war because they have the chance and motive to avoid responsibility and let others take the lead.","When attacking is easier than defending, countries are more likely to compete and fight wars with each other.",Consider every possible choice.,D
How is the idea of national defense related to how people view things based on their backgrounds and experiences?,"One can examine military defense using different viewpoints, and take an approach that sees cultural and social elements as significant areas of focus. This has resulted in suggestions that wider perspectives on military efforts should be embraced, including the proposed utilization of social and development experts in conflict situations.","People who believe that our understanding of reality is shaped by social factors reject the core principles that studies of military security are built on; by dismissing the evidence-based nature of security studies, the approach that views reality as socially constructed becomes insufficient in its efforts to develop theories about military security.",People who believe that society shapes our understanding tend to reject the core ideas behind theories focused on military power. They are likely to view military efforts as harmful and counterproductive to human wellbeing.,"To research matters related to defense and safety, experts need to first take an objective and practical stance. However, this view can later be merged with other perspectives, including one that considers how societal factors shape beliefs, to explore safeguarding various entities, such as the natural world or the well-being of individuals.",A
What role do public events where firearms are sold and traded play in the illegal weapons trade?,"Though criticized by some groups, events where guns are bought and sold have strong rules in place, making sure that people with past crimes cannot buy guns.",Events where firearms are bought and sold are controlled to make sure that weapons obtained through proper channels cannot be resold illegally or through unofficial means.,Events where guns are bought and sold do not play a major role in the illegal exchange of weapons.,"Events where guns and weapons are sold frequently do not require people to go through security checks before buying weapons, and create an atmosphere where the focus is more on cost rather than information about where the weapons will end up or how they will be used.",D

Has this organization become a risk to the safety of the country?,"Crime that crosses national borders is considered harmful for economic progress. Criminal groups are viewed as a danger to development because they weaken law and order, and discourage foreign investment by creating an unsafe environment in local communities. Moreover, criminals often invest their illegal gains in legal businesses and have an unfair advantage due to access to low-cost funds and the ability to bully competitors. In places with high levels of cross-border crime, genuine investors are often reluctant to invest their resources.","Criminal organizations undermine the stability of democratic systems. In many countries, international criminal groups have exploited the instability that has accompanied the transitions from communist regimes to democratic societies, using their influence within the highest levels of government to protect themselves from law enforcement. The corruption of public institutions and the perceived ineffectiveness of the rule of law in new democracies contribute to eroding public trust and loyalty in the new regime.","Criminals operating across national borders can easily avoid detection and transport illegal items and people, which makes it difficult for governments to enforce laws, protect their citizens, and provide public services. The illegal activities of these criminals also harm and corrupt many government agencies, allowing them to influence government policies in those countries.",Those previous statements are right.,D
How is an instrument that joins atoms together different from an instrument that breaks atoms apart?,"A destructive bomb has three stages. It uses an explosive device to create an initial explosion, which then triggers a much larger second explosion. It is sometimes called a thermonuclear or hydrogen bomb and has an incredibly high destructive capability.","Two small and simple pieces are brought together to form a bigger piece, which then breaks apart into smaller pieces. This breakup releases energy that can cause damage, with the amount of energy depending on the total size of the original pieces.","A fusion device works in two steps: first, a simple device is used to start a chain of splitting reactions, and the end result is an extremely powerful explosion with an unlimited amount of heat energy.",Combining certain materials can release a large amount of energy in a concentrated way. The exact amount of energy released can be precisely calculated based on the materials involved. Powerful weapons can be designed with different levels of destructive force tailored to the intended target.,A
"Making things easy to understand, which of the following statements best explains the meaning of the term 'materialism'?","The mentioned idea refers to HM's emphasis on dividing people based on economic status and the productive foundation of communities, as well as how social systems have the ability to evolve and bring about change.",Materialism refers to the origins of historical materialism in the schools of thought that came after modernism.,Materialism describes the emphasis on acquiring possessions and the importance of financial power in the approach.,"People who dismiss the importance of class-based political interactions focus on wealth, which they see as the gathering or ability to access physical possessions and resources, and they coined the term ""materialism"" to describe this perspective.",A
What happenings during the 1960s and 1970s could be seen as leading to the rise of concerns about protecting the natural world?,"Many experts from the 1970s tried to question and analyze the traditional views and approaches to security, emphasizing their failure to address environmental threats to the safety and well-being of nations and the world.","People started to realize that changes in the natural world not only harm plant and animal communities, but also put human health and quality of life at risk.",People in poorer nations started thinking more about caring for the planet.,Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: Each and every one of these choices.,D
Is TNC something that has recently emerged?,"Public safety reports did not have strong proof backing the idea that international criminal groups posed a major and growing danger during the 1980s and 1990s, beyond agreement that worries about crime levels arose due to the military rethinking its purpose after the Cold War ended.","Illegal businesses used to be limited to specific areas and separate from each other, but nowadays such unlawful operations tend to be interconnected, reinforcing one another, and more deeply ingrained within legitimate economic activities.",TNC represents a reaction by those without resources in response to the unequal economic growth across countries and the unfairness of global market systems combined with environmental limits on growth.,"Illegal activities across borders are now widespread and not limited to specific areas or ethnicities, affecting more groups and countries and increasing the size of the unlawful market compared to lawful trade.",B
"Here is the rephrased question without technical terms or jargon:

Which of the options is not a reaction to the illegal business of selling weapons?","An international agreement from 2001 aimed at preventing the illegal production and trade of guns, gun parts, and ammunition.","A 2001 United Nations initiative to stop the unlawful buying, selling, and distributing of small firearms and light weapons around the world.","In 2001, the United Nations Security Council issued a resolution recognizing the widespread impact of HIV/AIDS as a potential threat to the stability and safety of nations.",International agreement made in 2005 regarding the labeling and tracking of firearms.,C
Why was the involvement of women in wars overlooked as an important topic to study before the late 1900s?,"Women were not directly involved in fighting battles, so the idea of gender or the role of women was not seen as relevant when discussing matters of protection and safety.","Rephrased statement: The ways women were involved in violent acts, whether as those suffering harm, those causing harm, or other roles, were viewed in terms of how their involvement impacted the governing body, rather than their personal experiences or experiences as women.",Women's contributions were duly recognized; they played crucial roles in maintaining the prevailing security arrangements.,"Women tend to disapprove of fighting in wars and prefer to participate in movements against wars, making their involvement in studying war-related topics relatively small.",B
How are the main arguments against getting involved in another country's problems typically criticized?,"Here is the rephrased statement without technical terms or jargon:

People who take a practical view object to getting involved in other nations' problems because they assume each country's government will safeguard its own people.",The hardline view ignores the duties that come with being in charge.,People who criticize intervention to help others often ignore the many established laws and agreements about fundamental human rights and terrible crimes like genocide.,Here are all the possibilities that have been mentioned.,D
How would you best explain what the word 'globalization' means?,"People around the world are adopting similar dominant beliefs and values, bringing them together into an ideological group that is mostly shaped by the economic principles of free-market systems.",People interacting more closely with each other in different parts of the world and becoming more dependent on each other is the result of the shrinking of distances and faster ways of doing things through new inventions.,"Bringing people around the world into closer interaction with each other, mainly in terms of trade and technology, can be described as the ""shrinking"" of the global community. This process started in the early 1900s and was driven by the ideas that originated from Western European countries.","Becoming more connected globally started happening in the 1980s, starting from Western Europe where there was a lot of political influence and technological progress. This increased interconnectedness is a direct result of improvements in communication and transportation technologies that make it easier to move physical things, people, and ideas around the world efficiently.",B
How could weaker countries face difficulties from forces outside their borders?,"Dominant countries can use various persuasive tactics to make weaker nations follow global rules. This could involve limiting trade or denying access to arms deals, which reduces the smaller nation's ability to fund or equip their military forces, potentially leading to discontent and potential overthrow of the government by military personnel.","States with poor control face dangers from the widespread availability of handheld weapons, which can be used to defy their authority. These portable firearms can be obtained through lawful and unlawful means and are common in areas with powerful local leaders, criminal groups, and private armed forces.","Struggling nations cannot remain separate from worldwide connections. Boundaries becoming more open lead to movement of people. To be able to compete on a global scale, struggling nations seek financial help or support from international organizations. However, these processes weaken the dominant idea of the nation, and societal identity becomes unclear, making it hard for the nation to maintain its ideological appeal.",You may select any or all of the available choices.,D
How might tensions and mistrust between groups arise from each group's desire to protect their distinct way of life?,"People with strong feelings of pride for their shared culture and values can lead to two different situations: one that brings people together positively, and another that divides them negatively. When people's strong sense of cultural identity and loyalty is tied to a specific ethnic group, it can be seen as harmful and potentially cause conflicts or even the breakdown of a nation. However, when people's strong sense of cultural pride is focused on the wider society and existing boundaries, it is generally viewed as a positive force that strengthens unity and works within the established system.","It is hard to clearly separate cultural pride and political aims: cultural pride movements may sometimes feel the need to change from solely celebrating their culture into pursuing political goals, blending with political movements.","Here is the statement rephrased without technical terms and jargon: Powerful individuals or groups may overstate dangers or risks in order to gain backing from the public, which can trigger a cycle of escalating responses between opposing sides.",Here are a few options you can consider.,D
"How can we explain the phrase 'security dilemma' using simple words, and what effect does it have on the safety and well-being of different countries around the world?","Constant fear and suspicion between countries can actually help keep the peace by putting all countries at equal risk of military attack, discouraging an unproductive build-up of military power; while this dynamic is primarily limited to military matters, it can have wide-ranging consequences.","In a world without a single ruling authority, nations are forced to rely on their own military strength for protection; however, other nations may view this as a threat, leading to an escalating cycle of military buildup. This problem extends beyond military matters and impacts political and societal aspects as well.",There is a continuous feeling of being unsafe that comes from the common way of thinking about national safety. This feeling of being unsafe will have greater effects on people's safety and society's safety than on areas like politics and the military.,"Situations where countries feel threatened have effects beyond just military issues, although their impact on the safety and well-being of societies is restricted. The term mainly refers to how countries perceive their own military strength in relation to their neighbors.",B
Can someone who is not very familiar with military terminology understand this question more easily? Arms control as a policy decision to limit weapons - which of these statements does NOT describe that?,"Security arrangements involving joint efforts are one way of dealing with countries feeling threatened and taking measures against such threats, which may then make other countries feel threatened.",Efforts to limit and reduce weapons were made during the tense period in an attempt to achieve safety.,"Agreements to control weapons don't question the importance of weapons and military might in global dynamics; instead, they address issues caused by certain types of weapons and connections between countries.","Arms control policies, which proved useful during the tense period between the United States and the Soviet Union, continue to be relevant and implemented in current global security situations.",D
How can we categorize acts of violence against civilians? Do all violent groups share the same motivations and methods?,"People using religion as an excuse for violence seems to be common after the Cold War ended. This kind of violence is often linked to extreme Islamic groups. Al-Qaeda is the most well-known group of this kind and operates worldwide, but there are other groups like this too, not just al-Qaeda. Christian beliefs were also used to justify kicking people out of an area because of their ethnicity in Bosnia, as well as murders of people who support abortion rights in the USA.","Criminal groups have derived their beliefs from different schools of thought. There was a surge of criminal violence in Europe during the 1970s and 1980s stemming from various left-leaning and communist ideologies, but these started to decline by the late 1980s. Right-wing groups are also present, often with openly hostile and prejudiced views towards foreigners, targeting immigrants and foreign workers.","People with shared cultural backgrounds or languages tend to form a wide range of groups, including those involved in violent acts. In some countries, many groups fighting against colonial rule were based on ethnic ties and used violent tactics in their struggles for independence. In some cases, these loyalties and violent methods persisted even after independence was achieved. A sense of belonging to a particular ethnic or linguistic group, combined with a desire for a separate homeland or independence from another ethnic group, has often been a strong driving force behind violent actions.",Those options are all valid.,D
What types of people or groups take part in the weapons and military equipment business?,The sharing and buying of weapons is a proper business matter between countries.,Armies and other armed forces are the only ones involved in the business of producing and selling weapons and defence equipment.,"People in government are not the only ones involved in the trade of weapons. Organizations and groups outside of governments, including illegal ones, also play a significant role.",The illegal buying and selling of weapons and firearms between non-government entities refers to the defence trade.,C
In what ways did the management of employees change during and after the period of major political tension between the United States and Soviet Union?,"In the time after the Cold War ended, there has become a growing difference between the way security issues are looked at and analyzed, and the study of history and memory, with history and memory being pushed aside and left out from the mainstream way of studying these topics.","After HM became widely known during the Cold War period, it has slowly been accepted into discussions about security, and is now considered one of the main ways of thinking within the field of security studies.","The bad reputation associated with human migration during the Cold War era limited its importance at that time, excluding it from mainstream security analysis. After this period, the expansion of security studies has led to greater inclusion of human migration as a topic for research.","After the Cold War ended, HM emerged as a new way to study security issues, and it continued to gain popularity in the subsequent security climate. Its association with influential figures during the Cold War also contributed to its notable achievements.",C
"In what ways is the organization connected to extremist violent activities, and how much?","Terrorist groups and global criminal organizations are increasingly working together after the end of the Cold War. This partnership allows terrorist groups to find new sources of money. For most terrorist groups, criminal activities have become one of the most important ways to get funds, with terrorist networks spreading globally in connection with the spread of illegal market activities.",A connection between terrorist groups and criminal organizations is usually a short-term exception. Different long-term strategic objectives meant that levels of cooperation were generally temporary situational partnerships that would have little widespread impacts.,"There is growing proof that terrorist groups and criminal organizations operating across borders are working together, but there is no agreement on whether this is a permanent strategic partnership or temporary partnerships formed for mutual benefit.",Any of these choices.,C
How would someone explain the connection between scholars who study the real workings of nations and scholars who research peace in the early 1960s?,"Both those studying methods to promote harmony and those prioritizing practical realities believed academic efforts should concentrate on the growing buildup of weapons by opposing military forces. While there were disagreements between the groups regarding their proposed solutions to this critical situation, there was agreement that the group of nations aligned with the Soviet Union should no longer possess nuclear weapons capabilities, giving preference to the continued existence of Western nations governed by the people.",The group studying peace looked beyond the gathering of nuclear weapons for their area of focus; this caused disagreements with the other group who believed that having greater military power was the most important thing for gaining security.,"Researchers studying peaceful solutions identified the increase in weapon production as a consequence of the League of Nations' inability to resolve conflicts, while scholars who believed in the pursuit of national interests deemed it to be the expected outcome of the ideological differences between the Soviet-aligned countries and Western democratic nations. This led to significant disagreements between the research goals of the two groups.","As tensions between Eastern and Western nations escalated during the Cold War period, a clear division emerged between those who prioritized practical strategies for preserving democratic societies and others who advocated for comprehensive studies on achieving lasting peace. The first group aimed to direct research efforts toward securing the interests of Western democracies, while the latter viewed this perspective as overly limited and biased in favor of Western ideologies.",D
Which result is very important when it comes to having reliable energy sources?,Efforts to gain authority over energy sources in the Southern region have effects on the long-term viability of collaboration among major global powers; the rise of competing interests and tensions over this type of authority poses risks for global peace and stability.,Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: Every one of these choices.,"People who are worried about not having enough energy resources come together, leading to more talks and teamwork between countries.","Poorer countries gain influence on the world stage because wealthy nations need the energy resources found in those poorer countries, allowing the poorer nations to reduce global divisions and unfairness between rich and poor nations.",A
How did certain situations influence opinions about keeping the surroundings safe and secure?,"The end of political and military tensions between world powers allowed for a re-examination of policies related to protection and safety in the context of increasing public awareness of environmental issues, with a focus on collective action across nations.","In 1973, the group of countries that export oil reduced their oil supply, which highlighted the limitations on the production capabilities of the military, leaving a deep psychological effect that required security concerns to be linked to national priorities: securing deals for energy sources and protecting the environment became connected to the use of diplomatic efforts related to military strength.","The protection of land and borders became more important than the need to defend a particular belief system after the end of communism. Defending against potential threats from nearby areas was a key concern. However, environmental issues remained a low priority for the security organizations dealing with the new security situation following the Cold War.","The end of tensions between major world powers opened up the possibility for expanding security concerns beyond just military threats. Researchers from political science and environmental fields explored how new security issues could be handled. However, the large number of publications produced had little impact on actual policies.",A

How are the concepts of human memory and representing things as they truly are connected?,Muted approaches and realistic perspectives assume that some clear truths are present within communities.,"Historical Materialism shares some similarities with realistic, liberal, and socially constructed perspectives, but its uniqueness lies in highlighting the class struggle within the capitalist system as its core emphasis.","Even though Historical Materialism acknowledges the significance of a country as an active participant in global affairs, it also suggests that countries prioritize the interests of the wealthy and powerful elite who govern them.",Everything previously mentioned,D
How did certain things help criminal activities that crossed country borders grow in the 1990s?,"Illegal activities across borders increased due to reduced spending on military forces and downsizing of armies, which lowered the perceived danger of such operations.","TNC as an idea arose within scholarly circles, connected to people's safety worries and chances for progress in struggling nations, as a way to settle disagreements and create peace in Europe.","People acting criminally across national borders have existed for a long time. Among those who make policies, the rising attention to these criminal activities results from improvements in intelligence-gathering and communication technology, which have allowed a clearer understanding of how widespread and extensive the problem truly is.",Worldwide connections like increased travel and trade may have accidentally created new opportunities for criminal activities across different countries.,D
"How come a lot of scholars who study women's rights see keeping women out of the military, or away from fighting directly in wars, as a significant issue?","Those who have served in wars may get important and influential jobs, frequently in government and politics.","Taking part in activities related to armed forces is frequently seen as a display of might, love for one's country, and bravery.","Women's exclusion from decision-making processes is frequently justified using baseless and unfair reasoning, which can restrict women's broader involvement in community affairs.",Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon without changing the meaning: Each and every one of these choices.,D

How has the main area of study about safety from violence and conflict changed over the past 100 years when it comes to the armed forces?,"Studies related to safety have always included a variety of topics when looking at the field of safety. Different kinds of safety, especially human safety and financial safety, have received a lot of attention in traditional safety studies, along with military safety. After the Cold War, this approach was expanded to include other types of safety such as environmental and individual safety.","The ability to defend against armed forces has become the most important area of study when it comes to safety and protection; both experts and professionals understand the crucial need to prioritize military strength, as they believe that armed forces pose the gravest danger to the survival of people and nations.","Before the Cold War, studies on security mainly looked at military issues. However, concerns about environmental threats to security were quickly rising, pushing analysts to rethink the frameworks they had used before that focused solely on individual nations.","Important people during the period of tension between major world powers agreed that protection against military threats should be the main priority; as a result, there was little discussion about what security involved, other than military matters. After this period, the study of security has expanded to include the wider range of areas that we see today, such as environmental and political security.",D

Which of these statements does not relate to the growth of peace studies in the 1900s?,"One of the more recent areas of focus in the study of peace was looking into ways to prevent conflicts, resolve disputes, and maintain stability.","During the peak of tensions between major world powers after World War II, the academic discipline focusing on peaceful conflict resolution was often condemned as 'giving in' and faced strong opposition from those against it.","In the 1970s, well-known scholars studying peace urged for an expansion in the scope of their field, but their efforts to do so were mostly unsuccessful.","Efforts to promote harmony aimed to offer a broader perspective on major disagreements, beyond just the viewpoint of countries.",C
How can we best describe the study of peace in today's world?,"After the end of tensions between major world powers, the study of peace has grown into its own field, separate from others, that looks at solving conflicts, ensuring financial safety, and stopping violence among and within countries, differing from studies of development and international relationships.","Studying peace is best described by its goal of finding ways to end conflicts without using violence. Those who study peace take a broad view of resolving conflicts, with a focus on the issues surrounding violence and use of force, and try to target the instigating parties as the ones needing protection from harm.","The study of peace cannot be described as a particular scholarly method because its research topics and the different areas of interest for peace researchers constantly change. However, after the Cold War ended, the field has become so successful that it has several research centers and receives attention from scholars around the world working in various disciplines.","Peace studies focuses on understanding the root causes of issues in international relations, considering a worldwide perspective, combining knowledge from different fields, finding non-violent solutions, analyzing objectively while promoting ethical values, and connecting theoretical concepts with practical applications in research.",D
How does knowing things influence the way choices are made when dealing with money matters?,"People's decisions in economic matters are not based on factual information, but rather on their own personal understanding and view of the situation.","People's decisions about money are not influenced by facts, but are instead driven more by outside pressures that force them to act in certain ways rather than making choices based on logic.","People's choices are greatly affected by the details they know, because even though the idea is that people do what's best for themselves, what counts as the 'right choice' depends on the facts they have access to at that moment.","Knowledge and data have turned into valuable assets in the modern world and can be bought, sold, and exchanged like products in the market.",C
What are some common complaints or issues raised about HM?,"The theory does not give enough importance to the role of the worker, instead putting emphasis on the business owner as the source of authority and the most significant player. The theory can also refer to the power structures of business owners, which can negatively impact the well-being and safety of workers.","People frequently criticize the economic system of capitalism for only acting in ways that benefit itself, and they explain everything in terms of conflicts between different social classes, which prevents a more comprehensive analysis. Some versions of this way of thinking claim to have discovered definite laws of history, but the accuracy of these laws is widely debated.","The statement oversimplifies the intricacies of the economic system, acknowledging solely its detrimental aspects and damaging consequences.","Here is the rephrased statement without technical terms or jargon:

Which of the following statements best explains the focus of military protection within the commonly accepted ideas about safety studies?,"Different countries' relationships with each other are the main topic of study. Within this area, a smaller branch focuses on military protection and safety.","People's safety is a major priority when different countries interact with each other, and this topic takes up a lot of space in academic writings. In the study of how countries interact, some scholars focus specifically on strategic planning, and within that subset, issues related to safety are sometimes discussed.","Efforts to plan for dealing with major challenges between nations are best thought of as a part of studying relationships between countries, and within those planning efforts, protecting a country's military capabilities is one of the biggest worries. Studies about protection are a part of those broader planning efforts.","The defense and safety of armed forces are the main focus of strategic analysis; and strategic analysis is a part of the broader study of security matters.

How have powerful Western countries changed their use of pressure and threats in international relations since the rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union ended?,Forceful negotiations have shown to be an effective approach and a crucial part of managing conflicts. The positive outcomes of previous policy efforts in the period following the 9/11 attacks have strengthened the tendency towards forceful negotiations by increasing the American public's willingness to address large-scale terrorist attacks in unstable countries.,"A friendly overall situation, with the West having much greater military strength and little risk of opposition from major powers, has pushed Western leaders to pursue their goals and get involved in armed conflicts in struggling or failing countries.","The end of the division between the two opposing sides during the Cold War period did not lead to a decrease in conflicts; instead, it left behind an unstable situation where the use of force and retaliation on a large scale continues to pose a very real danger. The risk of uncontrollable escalation still exists, but in a different form - the main concern now is large-scale terrorist attacks, the spread of instability from failed states, and non-state groups seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction, requiring military intervention as a response.","Tense relationships between countries have pushed governments to use armed forces and war tactics to protect their interests. Using force instead of discussions or rewards has become the main reaction to dangers, whether from other nations, lack of resources, disease outbreaks, or other unconventional threats.",B
How much and in what ways has the environment become seen as a security issue?,Turning environmental issues into security matters has made them more important for both international and national security decision-makers and organizations. It is now widely accepted that changes in the environment can be seen as a major security concern.,"The protection of our natural surroundings has resulted in a shift of resources away from defense and towards addressing environmental challenges. Significant attention has been given to environmental changes as a potential source of violent disputes, as well as dealing with environmental threats originating from external factors beyond our borders.","The environment has been treated as an important political concern, with its protection being considered crucial for ensuring overall safety and well-being. This has, to some extent, increased the attention given to critical environmental issues among policymakers and government agencies, allowing the environment to be viewed as a matter of security. However, despite this increased awareness and recognition, there has been little concrete change in actual policies and actions taken to safeguard the environment, which was supposed to be the main objective of considering it as a security issue.","The view from the angle of protecting a country's safety has weakened the usefulness of the idea of protecting the environment as a security concern. Treating environmental issues as military problems has reduced policymakers' capacity to fully understand the crucial nature of environmental problems and how the environment impacts social vulnerability. Aligning the protection of the environment with protecting a country's safety, as well as global levels of international change, cannot be achieved without compromising the security interests of the country.",C
It makes mortgage lending less risky.,An unclear and wide-ranging understanding of safety can result in uncertainty and a lack of clear and consistent thinking.,"When the entity taking action is not the government, it may be uncertain what would be considered an extreme or exceptional step.","The approach depends on an explanation of separate political and security areas, which are not always clearly separated.",The idea of splitting things into separate parts lacks consistency when used as a technique for detailed examinations in the field of security.,D
"How would you describe the usual understanding of a country's safety, as different from the safety of individuals?",These choices allow for different possibilities.,"People's safety, freedom, and honor are the only true concerns when it comes to protecting the nation.",People's usual understanding of security and dangers creates important limits that determine what it means to be safe as a human.,It is not enough to only think about protecting our country because there are many different kinds of dangers we face today.,D
In what way does Buzan's idea of protecting the well-being of communities differ from the conventional ways people think about safety and security?,"Ensuring the long-term progress of the state relied on the safety and well-being of its people, which was a separate concern that was not less important or reliant on other areas, such as the armed forces.","People who wanted to expand the field of security studies argued for considering factors beyond strictly military threats, such as access to resources, environmental issues, and other areas of concern, once the tensions of the Cold War period ended.","Traditional military forces' continuous growth refers to the sustainable development of established patterns of military capabilities. The threats posed by military forces can be divided into different components, including the strength of their infrastructure, advanced technologies, personnel, economic resources, and political support within the military security sector.",People's concerns about security go beyond just protecting physical land and borders: groups of people with shared cultures and backgrounds became the main focus for keeping them safe and thriving.,B
What situation out of those listed does not affect people's safety and well-being?,"A situation where individuals are provided respite from the distressing experiences that hinder personal growth, are safeguarded from dangers, and shielded from harmful disturbances to their routine activities.","A situation where every person is safe from harm and violence, no matter their background or who they are.","A situation where individuals are assured the capability to exist and progress, unhindered by political mistreatment or bias, and protected from dangers posed by their own or outside governing forces.","People can live by themselves without needing help from the government, where individuals can take care of themselves and live safely without relying on government resources.",D
What happens when very powerful bombs explode?,"A powerful explosion creates an electric current pulse, intense heat and light, high pressures, and radioactive fallout immediately after detonation. The electric current pulse happens when high-energy radiation interacts with the atmosphere. This electric pulse is not harmful to people but can damage electronic devices. The effects of the electric pulse are strongest at high altitudes. However, the intense light can cause temporary blindness, eye damage, and fires, while the high pressures can lead to severe burns.","A massive explosion unleashes a powerful wave of pressure that can demolish sturdy buildings. In the past, military strategists relied on these devastating shockwaves to estimate the number of casualties within a five-mile area surrounding an extremely powerful aerial detonation, concluding that half the population would either lose their lives or sustain injuries.","Many types of explosions involving radioactive materials can lead to dangerous radiation exposure, either immediately after the blast or through radioactive particles spread into the air. A conventional bomb combined with radioactive materials aims to cause harm through spreading radiation, rather than the explosion itself. Even a small release of radioactive materials could cause widespread disruption and panic, potentially costing more than the actual damage from the explosion. Some experts suggest that the initial blast causes more harm than the spread of radiation.",Everything that was previously mentioned or presented,D
How would you describe the idea of reducing restrictions and barriers for business and trade?,Those who favor allowing businesses to operate freely are now the most significant group within the larger pro-liberty movement; they support policies that aim to redistribute wealth more evenly in an effort to reduce imbalances that could undermine stability in society and for those in power.,"Allowing freedom in business and commerce reduces the control of governments, and this view suggests that when possible, governments should oversee the markets. However, one weakness of this approach is that it can lead to less cooperation and more conflicts between countries.","When companies can freely buy and sell goods and services across borders without government interference, wealth grows faster and businesses are more productive.","Commercial liberalism supports limiting the influence of private companies and non-government organizations in the economy, stating that interference will disrupt economic growth and success.",C
How can the study of protection be seen as a field of knowledge related to ruling nations or empires?,Studies focused on protection and safety emerged due to the concerns of the USA and Britain after World War II.,Security studies sees the world from the viewpoint of those who colonized other countries and regions.,"Security studies initially focused on the influence and authority of the USA and Britain during a period when they were actively backing colonial and imperial relationships with countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",Choices available to consider taking into account.,D
What are the potential negative consequences that critics worry about if a country gets involved in another country's affairs to help people during a crisis?,Using power improperly to wage wars for the benefit of the nation.,"A decline in fighting abilities due to engaging in wars for moral reasons, resulting in a lack of protection from armed forces.","Some nations have shown they can wage righteous wars to safeguard the valuable principles of democratic governance and free-market economics, but not every nation would resort to force to further such widely beneficial goals.","People in authority not carrying out these entitlements, resulting in a failure to address violations against individuals.",A
"How did the report about human development from the United Nations, published in 1994, question or challenge the commonly accepted ideas and perspectives on security at that time?","The report identified seven important aspects of people's well-being that decision-makers should focus more resources and effort on: having enough money and resources, having enough food, being healthy, living in a safe environment, being safe from harm, having a strong community, and being free to participate in politics.","Communicable illnesses continue to be a major problem in poor countries, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, as emphasized by the report.","The report recommends an approach to understanding security that focuses on people, rather than just nations or military forces, to address the tendency in traditional security studies to overlook the significance of individuals' well-being.","Here's the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon:

Any of these choices.",D
How can we make sense of the ideas related to gender and feeling safe in terms of one's gender?,"Concerns related to gender are essentially an extension of how we understand the global political system. The analysis of relations involving gender and security has only become possible by expanding the traditional narrow definition of security, where national security in an unruly global society was exclusively the domain of men.","Looking into gender security means examining the part that adult females play in current armed conflicts, including industries connected to armed conflicts, and whether they are included or excluded from roles involving combat.","The topic examines how women are involved in situations related to safety and security, and their level of participation or lack thereof in military conflicts and the spread of military influence.","Looking at differences between men and women, and the issues related to protecting them, is a complicated job, and there is no single way to define these terms. The idea of protecting gender goes beyond just military protection to also include safeguarding general human well-being.",D
"What does the term ""security"" mean in today's world, based on the study of security-related topics?","A country is safe as long as it does not have to compromise its fundamental principles to prevent conflict, and if faced with a challenge, it can uphold those principles by winning the conflict.","Feeling safe is having minimal chances of fighting, combined with strong belief that losing will not result from any potential conflict.","People's liberation involves removing the physical and personal restrictions that prevent them from doing what they truly want to do. Freedom and security go hand in hand. True protection comes from liberating people, not from power or control. In theory, freedom itself is real safety.",Nothing from the options given is correct or applicable.,D
How can we best protect ourselves from online dangers?,Total elimination of dangers.,"Make sure the seriousness of online attacks is understood, and that cases of online attacks are reported, made known to the public, and dealt with right away.",Here is the statement rephrased without technical terms or jargon: Each and every one of these choices.,"The understanding that complete protection cannot be guaranteed, but instead creating adaptable computer networks while fostering global collaboration and data sharing in order to minimize risks and increase durability.",D

"When thinking about the idea of protecting people, important questions come up about the power and control of a nation. Regarding this conflict between protecting people and the nation's power, which one of these statements is not correct?","To give legal approval for actions taken by one country inside another country under the rule of protecting populations, the concept of a country's authority over its own territory is used, specifically the idea that such intervention is needed to ensure global safety.","To move beyond the debate surrounding outside involvement versus national independence, the principle of Responsibility to Protect aims to redefine what it means for a nation to hold authority over its own affairs.","To make it easier for useful aid to be provided, the approach of the responsibility to protect redefines the traditional understanding of a nation's authority within its own borders.",The idea behind the R2P approach is that having control over a region is fundamentally tied to duties and the obligation to safeguard the well-being of the people living there.,A
How could actions involving different countries be used? Are they useful or a problem?,"Negotiations cannot bring about agreements between a few countries when agreements among all countries have failed. Approval from all countries is needed to validate the process, leading to greater cooperation, agreements, and support from powerful countries. The inability to reach a universal understanding of what terrorism is will result in differences between countries' approaches to countering terrorism, which will greatly limit the ability to employ consistent and coordinated measures across multiple levels, and may allow some terrorist groups to find shelter in countries with weaker domestic laws.","People from different nations have tried hard to agree on what terrorism means so that all countries can work together to stop it. However, these efforts have mostly failed: countries often support or feel sympathy for those who use violence against oppressive governments; developing countries do not want anti-colonial struggles to be called terrorism; and countries want to keep some flexibility regarding handing over and punishing political dissenters.","Groups that gather information and knowledge are extremely focused, structured systems that function at their peak within their national boundaries. There is no evidence that working together would improve their capability to stop violent acts. Additionally, involving multiple groups would increase the chances of mistakes, misunderstandings, and failures in obtaining accurate information.","Efforts involving multiple groups to support the required changes for stopping acts of terrorism have not been successful. Imposing penalties on countries that provide a physical location for terrorist activities may be misdirected, having little impact on the terrorist groups themselves.",B
How would Krause and Williams describe the type of research that would most likely appeal to a wide range of researchers in the field of security studies?,"To challenge the main focus, to question the common belief that military strength is most important for a country, and to modify the way safety and protection are examined.","To tackle safety matters from an optimistic viewpoint, questioning the prevalence of conventional safety approaches, and redirecting scholarly focus towards the individual as a point of reference.","To challenge the prevailing views in global affairs, to apply insightful analysis to the security concerns faced by countries, and to address the inequalities that lead to internal conflicts within nations.","To consider all possible things that could be threatened and broaden the understanding of what 'security' means, so that it covers anything that might threaten those things.",A
What things affect the results of using threats or pressure to get something from another country?,The overall situation across the world; kind of hostile action; idea or portrayal of armed conflict.,Pressure applied by one or more groups; cutting off the opponent; clear goals; strong reasons and different levels of determination.,"A clear understanding of what needs to be done, strong guidance from those in charge, backing from people within the country, backing from other countries, the other side's fear of making things worse, and clear terms for how things will be resolved.","Clear language can help communicate complex topics better: George and Simons differentiate between situational factors that contribute to positive outcomes, and the notion that decision-makers should consider these factors at various points during policy development.",D
Why is the lack of central authority important to the realistic view of how countries interact with each other?,"The absence of authority does not mean that there is no structured community or nationwide governing system, but rather that these are not separate and distinct from the society itself.","A situation where there is no single authoritative governing body - no overseeing power beyond the numerous countries. In the absence of such a central authority, each nation pursists its own objectives for attaining safety and security, and can set its own aims and conduct accordingly.","Major leadership changes result in inconsistent international relations approaches, as new leaders have different concerns and beliefs, leading to shifts in foreign policy directions.","The condition where countries feel they are part of a larger whole with shared interests and goals, leading to extensive and meaningful cooperation among them, is characterized by the absence of a central authority or governing structure.",B
What common ideas have become widely accepted and popular in the concept of human security since the Human Development Report?,Looking at protection only in terms of armed conflict is too narrow.,Safety is an idea that can be argued about or challenged.,Concentrating protection measures solely on physical fights is too limiting.,"Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon without changing the meaning:

What is the most accurate way of describing the meaning of 'international regime' according to the liberal political philosophy?,"The phrase ""international regime"" refers to the rules, structures, and systems that shape a country's role and interactions within the global community.","A set of guidelines or rules, either written or unwritten, that those in power follow when making choices about a specific topic.",International groups are separate organizations created by a partnership of government and non-government groups to manage decision-making processes that involve multiple countries.,"International groups are also called worldwide organizations and have an essential role as campaigners, promoting the perspectives of concerned parties to governmental players.",B
How can we describe having a reliable and sufficient supply of energy resources?,"Having enough energy resources today, including fuel sources, to meet the entire world's need for power is crucial for energy security.","The safety of the country's military operations depends on having enough energy available to cover the military's needs, making the military the main focus of energy-related security concerns.","To make sure we have enough energy available now and in the future, considering any expected changes in how much energy we need.",Obtaining the necessary energy sources to support people's activities and the operations of businesses and organizations without interruption is what energy security means.,C
What qualities best describe a country with an ineffective governing system?,"Leaders of weak nations often struggle to maintain control over armed forces and prevent conflicts from arising. Even in countries with strong military capabilities, leaders may face disloyalty and the risk of military intervention. When armed forces lack proper equipment, training, and unity, powerful societal groups can resist the government's authority. As a result, maintaining a monopoly over the means of violence is rare in weak states.","Unstable countries tend to have a society that is very united, which is linked to the ruling government's methods of maintaining control, leading those methods to become accepted as normal by the people.","People without much authority have the ability to use force and make others follow rules, even if some try to resist. However, these rulers lack genuine support from the public, so they maintain control through the use of violence, which becomes an accepted part of that society.","Ineffective or unstable governments do not use force or compulsion in their regular policies. Typically, the governing bodies in a country have well-established administrative systems that validate their authority to govern. Contradictorily, the more an ineffective government employs forceful methods, the more it strengthens its ability to enforce policies but diminishes its capacity to rule effectively.",A
What makes theories about safety and protection different from other theories?,"The study of security looks at the differences and connections between the study of strategy and the study of security, as well as how these relate to the overall theories of international relations, security studies, and security theories.","The main focus of discussions around security has been to give shape to practical matters - approaches, resource management in defense, and how decisions are made - as well as the structured ways of separating tasks that have defined those areas.","Complex ideas related to protection have been studied and developed in distinct stages, often with different groups not acknowledging each other's work, more so than in similar areas of study.","Discussions focused on whether being ready for offense or defense is more realistic, the significance of ideas versus the role of strength and established systems in ruling powers and ruling territories.",C
"In simpler words, how does the strong focus on individual rights impact the type of liberalism that prioritizes those rights?",People's freedom to make choices for themselves is important in today's society that values human rights.,A viewpoint focused on individual freedoms will support the division of territories when fighting and violence appear unavoidable if territories remain united.,"People who believe in freedom focus especially on those facing hardship due to their economic situation, sexual identity, gender, religious beliefs, or political views.",Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon without changing the meaning: Each of these choices.,D
How would a top-down view of large multinational companies affect decision-making or rules?,Criminal groups with organized structures mainly stay within their home country or cultural group and have limited ability to operate across different nations.,"People with higher ranks think that leaders have usually exaggerated the amount of violence and money made from their actions. If the money earned is not as much as commonly believed, their danger to legal business is greatly diminished.","Groups with multiple levels that have the ability to break into smaller, flexible teams are very adaptable and resistant to efforts by authorities who follow strict hierarchies and rankings to stop cooperation.",People at the top of organized criminal groups cause great harm through crimes motivated by money under a central authority figure. Targeting the money they make or those in charge would reduce their threat to legal businesses.,D
How does the idea of keeping people safe and secure shape our knowledge of security matters?,People have found it difficult to accept the idea of human security as an important topic among security experts or policy makers. There is a widespread inability to appreciate the political and academic worth of human security as a concept.,"People started talking more about human security in the mid-1990s, bringing attention to important issues. Specifically, the study of human communities has focused on the problem of violence within countries, which has become the main issue for security studies after the Cold War.","People's safety is not necessarily threatened by the idea of protecting countries from outside military force. However, this idea alone is not enough because it fails to address the safety of people living within those countries.","People's safety and well-being have become the main idea in studying current security issues. After the Cold War ended, the view that only the security of countries matters became outdated, and now there is a widespread understanding that the focus should be on protecting individual people within those countries.",C
What are the key parts of a country's overall system for controlling trade related to national security?,"Laws should be made by governments that put restrictions on the exchange of weapons, and there should be punishments if these laws are broken.",Governments should make sure that companies making weapons put a special and distinct marking on their military products.,"Authorities should secure storage of weapons and get rid of old, unnecessary, or outdated weapons.",You can choose any one or all of the given possibilities.,D
What conditions must be met for a compelling threat or demand to succeed?,"For influence to work, one side should not make excessive threats against the other; the threat needs to be believable; the opposing side must see the demands as reasonable; the influencing side must assure that meeting the demands won't lead to more demands; and the conflict shouldn't be seen as a situation where one side loses for the other to win.","To influence someone's actions without using force, the pressure applied must be strong enough to make resisting unacceptable. The threat of consequences must be believable. The person must have enough time to follow the instructions. The person must be reassured that compliance won't lead to more demands. Both sides must see the situation as one where compromise is possible.",Warnings should be convincing enough to make the other side feel that not obeying would be extremely difficult; the threat must be believable; the opponent must have adequate time to follow the order; the person issuing the warning should not use fear tactics against the opponent.,Clear warning of negative consequences must be strong enough to make not following demands extremely difficult; no military force should be involved; the opposing side should have enough time to comply with what is asked of them; the party issuing demands must assure the opposing side that following demands will not lead to future requests; the situation must not be seen as one where only one side can benefit at the expense of the other.,B
Which traits identify the group of organisms labeled 'Category B' by the United States Centers for Disease Control?,"General agents that pose minimal danger or illness within populations, but can negatively impact the capacity of a group to carry out physical activities.","Category B agents mention newly identified dangerous materials which could potentially be used as biological weapons if developed further, unlike Category A agents.","Moderately harmful threats, including those to food and water supplies, fall into Category B.",Living things that are hard to cure with medicine and result in many deaths are classed as Category B.,C

Which of the following is not a clear advantage of applying a 'critical' way of thinking in the field of protecting and defending a country?,"A more thorough way of looking at military defense research will allow for the addition or adoption of perspectives other than traditional ones, such as those that consider social factors.","Careful study of armed forces protection will shift focus back to long-standing views of state-led models, which have been overlooked in recent times, as states have instead preferred safety of people and other unconventional approaches.","By carefully examining the situation, we can understand that old ideas about keeping a country safe through military means may no longer always apply and might need to be rethought.",A careful way of thinking would acknowledge the evolving nature of what security means in the actual world. These changes are clear in the new approaches to warfare seen in the past and present centuries.,B
"What determines a culture where there is rivalry but no active desire to harm or conquer others, according to Wendt's three categories?","A situation where people don't control themselves some of the time, and they can't count on others to support them.","The rephrased statement is: A way of behaving marked by competition, which has been prevalent since the start of the current system of countries, where parties view each other as opponents but show some control over their use of force.","A society based on friendship, where using force or violence is avoided and working together is preferred when dealing with security matters.","A way of life where staying alive depends on military strength, problems related to protection are common, and protection for one group means lack of protection for others.",B
How does the way we view those affected influence how we perceive gender safety concerns?,"Women being portrayed as 'helpless victims' is a common storyline in tales of war. In 1990, around 90% of those impacted by wars were ordinary citizens, mostly women and children. The notion that women suffer the most during conflicts has reinforced the long-standing idea that women rely on men for safety, and that men must put their own well-being at risk to shield women and their nation (often portrayed as one and the same through misleading messages and visuals).","The idea of men being naturally brave and noble has been pushed aside as the emotional scars of warfare, abandonment, and forced military service have become more visible. When picturing those who have suffered, we no longer separate people by gender. Instead, there is an increasing belief that those who engage in combat are valiant and admirable, while those who do not take on qualities traditionally associated with women.","More people realize that wars are cruel and cause mental issues, leading to a change in the belief that going to war is normal for men. In modern societies worldwide, men are seen as victims of gender expectations that force them to act violently as 'protectors' or aggressors for their country.",You can choose any of the provided choices.,A
How does the topic of gender relate to the study of security and safety matters?,"Vulnerable groups such as women and children rely on the government for safeguarding and well-being, and the field that examines issues related to safety should consider them and address their requirements.","People's physical and mental characteristics, influenced by their gender, make them more or less suitable for various roles in safeguarding their community or nation.",People's biological characteristics should not matter in the field of Security Studies - we should create an environment that does not consider gender-related topics.,"Societal beliefs about what it means to be a man or woman define the behaviors and responsibilities that are expected of each gender, and by examining these artificial expectations, we can explore important questions about how we view safety and protection.",D
What is the purpose of economic restrictions?,To use financial strength as a way to promote harmony and liberty.,To stop providing money and resources to governments that act in ways that society sees as wrong.,To separate and reduce the strength of governments that pose a risk to the safety of nearby or worldwide areas.,Here is the statement rephrased to remove all technical terms and jargon without changing the meaning: Every one of these choices.,D
"In simpler terms, considering how industries are growing, what are the chances of having reliable and sufficient energy sources in the future?","Wealthier countries keep using more and more energy sources. Meanwhile, poorer countries use less energy overall because they have fewer large factories and industries in their economies. The expectations are that the energy demands from poorer countries will stay relatively low compared to richer countries.","People's need for energy in developed countries has reached its highest point in recent years, and information suggests that energy usage levels in the Northern regions have stabilised and are unlikely to rise further.","While estimates suggest that energy usage in wealthy nations will continue rising, the biggest increase in demand will come from poorer countries, creating major challenges for ensuring a reliable global energy supply.","Even though countries that are still developing will want more of the limited energy resources that are left, progress in finding new ways to generate energy from other sources, along with better knowledge of how much energy is available and how to access it, will ensure that there is enough energy available for the near future.",C
Which of these options does not describe the thing properly?,"People or things that take action or do not take action, creating a safe or unsafe situation.",Being truly safe means understanding what safety looks like and what circumstances are required for us to claim that we are safe.,The thing or person we take action to protect or make safe.,"When something is clearly a security concern, no matter how it is perceived or interpreted.",D
How do people in powerful positions try to influence others outside their group?,"A common way for governments to increase their power and control has been to force foreign workers and people who are not of the same ethnic group out of the country, and to limit people fleeing war or poverty from entering the country.","Countries without much power try to avoid partnerships with powerful nations because joining together and getting help often requires becoming more democratic, and there can be negative consequences if those requirements are not fulfilled.",Weaker countries are now frequently using private military or security companies and foreign fighters to increase their military strength and protect themselves from internal threats.,Unstable or struggling governments may take military action to try to improve their influence in the region and gain internal public support by presenting an imagined threat from outside as something to unite against. This tactic is often used to divert attention away from economic or social issues the country is facing.,C
"How does research after the Cold War period highlight issues faced by women related to conflicts, progress, and safety?","Modern improvements have made warfare somewhat equal for men and women. Having battles through technology rather than in person has settled the past conflict between citizens and the security forces; if real combat isn't needed, then male and female soldiers can engage in warfare on the same level. However, the advancements are still uneven, so the gender situation varies in different areas based on their development and security concerns.",The ability to fight battles with less harm to ordinary people has removed the risk of physical and biological attacks based on gender. The current differences between genders are shaped by 'non-violent' issues related to economic and social difficulties.,"The disputes in armed conflicts and the differences between males and females are rooted in the traditional agreement between the individual and the governing authority. The discussion about the 'entitlement to engage in combat' holds equal significance and relevance worldwide, applying to all circumstances.","Powerful weapons capable of causing widespread destruction have made combat equally dangerous for both men and women in terms of their destructive power. In the past, traditional warfare on battlefields exposed women to violence and sexual violence after the fighting ended, but these threats are no longer present.",A
How could guns and other weapons owned by governments or law enforcement end up being sold illegally?,Countries have enough power to make sure their weapons remain under their authority and are not sold illegally.,There is no proof to indicate that weapons owned by governments might be exchanged illegally through unregulated or semi-legal arms trading.,The unlawful selling and buying by countries is the main route through which weapons obtained through proper channels could eventually reach the unauthorized weapons market.,"During times of chaos and lack of strong authority, people often take things that do not belong to them, particularly when weapons are easily accessible.",D
How has the idea of protecting and ensuring the well-being of people been important?,"Protecting people's well-being has highlighted the link between fighting and progress, which is a helpful idea. The importance of the connection between progress and fighting is not only that it raises moral concerns about human suffering and unfairness but also that its frequent results, called state instability, have severe local, regional, and global impacts.",The idea helps to bring attention to positive global standards. Human security often acts as a broad standard. Creating positive global standards is not only crucial for moral reasons but also because they help to improve nations and the global community.,"People's safety is becoming more threatened and complex, not just countries' safety. These changes have led to discussions about redefining what safety means and expanding its scope. Issues like violence within countries can create serious problems locally, regionally, and globally.",Here are various choices.,D
Which of these options does not correctly describe the study of security issues from a critical perspective?,The thing being discussed can be thoroughly examined and should be understood in that way.,The person responsible for protecting something and the thing being protected should not be considered as separate entities.,Critical Security Studies is a different way of thinking that questions and challenges traditional beliefs and assumptions.,The rephrased statement is: Important Security studies challenges the fundamental assumptions and ways of knowing of other approaches in the field of Security Studies.,A
"How might military forces impact environmental safety, and what are the different ways this could happen?",War helps people gain access to resources and aids in developing environmentally-friendly ways; it can secure routes and rights that would otherwise be denied; rebuild infrastructure and equal access to resources; benefit the management of environmental issues; and also strengthen social institutions and unity.,"When looking at the armed forces and security organizations, some of the biggest conflicts with the idea of environmental safety arise. Armed conflicts harm the long-term growth of a country, but military forces may be needed to handle the effects.","More powerful armed forces and new inventions have made less damage to nature, using smaller amounts of resources, while the threat of devastating wars has decreased since the Cold War ended.",You can choose any or all of these possibilities.,B
Which of the available options does not fit or relate to the use of financial measures for security purposes?,Stopping the ability to buy and sell products within the country.,Regulations preventing certain products and information from leaving the country in order to maintain an edge over other nations and support goals related to international relations.,Regulation of weapons and equipment used for warfare trading.,Limiting outside products from entering the country in order to safeguard the local market.,A
What plans do international criminal groups have for expanding their illegal activities?,"People who study markets believe that international criminal activities function similarly to business operations in terms of their large scale and widespread reach. Criminal organizations are therefore very difficult to stop by law enforcement due to their massive size. What sets them apart is the creation of highly complex networks of cooperation between criminal groups, enabling them to continue operating under competitive market conditions.","Market experts believe that the illegal partnerships form powerful and wealthy groups, far more significant than what government and official sources suggest. From this viewpoint, the legitimate economy faces a substantially higher risk.",Experts studying business trends think that crimes committed by professionals and companies greatly damage legitimate business practices. Those criminal organizations are more likely to use force and bribery compared to regular criminal groups due to the large amounts of money invested in their illegal operations.,"People who study markets believe that criminal groups are disorganized, acting more like sellers of illegal products and services rather than one structured organization. Those who support this view downplay the danger criminal groups pose to governments and societies.",D
How did the conclusion of tensions between major world powers influence the dynamics of armed group leadership?,"During times of a failing government, influential people intentionally create chaos to engage in business activities and take advantage of illegal global markets that would not be allowed under normal circumstances. The rise of warlords represented a new way for leaders with little power to maintain control.","The following rephrased statement removes technical terms and jargon without changing the original meaning: Powerful local leaders represented the continuation of long-standing systems of sharing resources within the community, but these systems were maintained by different political sources. Support from major world powers was replaced by approval from the dominant US influence after the Cold War ended.","Local leaders used violence to gain power due to the quick worldwide changes caused by the end of the tensions between the United States and Soviet Union, and increasing global connections, but this was a temporary issue in the regular operation of the country and reflected the urgent need to secure access to basic resources.","Local armed groups took advantage of weak government systems and scattered military forces for their own gain. Unofficial business activities grew after the Cold War ended, but this was not part of a larger strategic plan.",A
How could the harmful consequences influence the choice to use dangerous substances against a location or group?,"Weapons using dangerous substances are a very complex way to carry out an attack. The difficulty in controlling these substances (how quickly they disperse, how stable they are, and their concentration levels) often fails to align with the intended goals.","People worry that it may be easy to make dangerous substances. These substances could be easily moved and hidden, and quickly released. Many of these substances can be spread through the air, like with agricultural sprayers or aerosol cans. Releasing these substances in poorly ventilated or crowded areas could have severe consequences.","Harmful materials can lead to many people getting hurt or dying. Even mild exposure to these dangerous substances causes severe harm, and if used as weapons, they would result in numerous injuries and loss of life.","Weather conditions, ground surface, and temperature can impact the deadliness and duration of a harmful substance, depending on the extent and level of exposure to the target.",D
"How are conflicts, defense matters, and the study of safety and stability connected?",Conflict between nations or groups is the most sensible approach to advance political aims; it is a way to further political objectives through force instead of diplomacy.,"War should be viewed as an abnormal and unnatural occurrence in society, caused by a complete breakdown in the ability of people to stay united and work together.",Conflict occurs when groups or individuals use force and violence to defend their desires and goals.,"Armed fighting occurs on a large scale involving countries or nations, stemming from their inability to regulate the actions of their people.",A
In what ways has the use of pressure and threats been explored in recent studies about keeping people safe?,Persuading or forcing someone through negotiations is connected with taking military action before being attacked.,"Persuasive negotiations are a gentle approach to global power discussions, which has been neglected in recent times.",Using fear or intimidation to force someone to do something has been the main approach in recent examples of pressuring nations through diplomatic means.,We have various possible choices or alternatives.,A
How can we decide if forceful negotiations have achieved the desired outcome or not?,Determining whether the threat or actual use of force in a specific situation is effective or not depends on whether the level of force used was enough to make the other side obey. The key question is whether the amount of force applied was sufficient to make them comply.,"Achieving the desired result does not depend on the level of force used to gain obedience. In an ideal situation, force should be employed to resolve all conflicts. If the line from convincing to compelling is crossed, the level of accomplishment equals the intended outcome: to halt or reverse an action.","In long and difficult talks with many back-and-forth exchanges that lead to small wins but then new issues, getting the desired outcome (the other party agreeing and stopping their actions) is seen as a success in terms of achieving the main goal.","When a country persuades another country through warnings and penalties (positive incentives may or may not be used), it is considered an easy victory. However, if military force is used to achieve compliance, it is considered a costly victory. For an outcome to be considered successful, the compliance must be long-lasting.",D
How could the natural world around us pose potential dangers or threats?,"Ensuring safety involves looking at the state of the worldwide environment, as well as its interconnected smaller parts and human systems that cross national borders.","Protecting the environment is an important task that challenges the idea of who or what needs protection from the risks posed by traditional safety policies, or whether connections can be made between environmental issues, safety concerns, and development challenges.","Looking at how changes to the environment lead to violent clashes within countries and between nations, and how environmental issues can threaten a country's overall safety and stability.","Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: All of the choices apply. The environment needs protection but also creates risks, even though people may understand this differently. While expanding the idea of security, it has important practical parts but the usefulness of the concept is debated.",D
What view do people who support freedom take towards groups that operate across countries?,Liberalism believes that groups of nations coming together can improve the safety and security of individual nations as well as the world. It supports the involvement of non-governmental groups and various other parties to promote cooperation and build connections between communities.,The idea promoted by those who favor freedom that working together increases safety is weakened by the inability of worldwide groups like the league of nations to stop large-scale fights.,"Across various liberal perspectives, there is a broad agreement that the participation of global groups in the political structure eventually weakens safety by stripping power away from the nation as a singular entity.","Here is the rephrased statement, without technical terms and jargon:

You can choose any of the available choices.",A
How do shared attitudes and beliefs shape our understanding of concepts and ideas?,Everything listed below.,"People's shared sense of belonging and the way they interact together creates their culture, but while culture is important for understanding how social identity works, there is a lot of disagreement about how relevant it is for studying security issues.","People's interests, goals, and desires are seen as more important than cultural factors in understanding individuals and how they develop.",Shared traditions and ways of living are seen as something that provides explanation for shared encounters and actions; it can influence how countries view safety and is essential in forming the beliefs and guidelines that shape how people see themselves.,D
What is one effect of typical changes to government policies that aim to improve the economy on people living in poverty?,"Prices of goods brought into the country sharply increase, including essential items like medicines from other countries. The cost of basic food items becomes higher, creating more financial strain for families with limited money to spend.","With less money being put into healthcare, education, and social services, along with the requirement for people to pay for these services, many regular folks couldn't afford medical care or an education. Letting go of government employees and stopping salary increases meant there were fewer teachers and doctors available.","Many unnecessary jobs have been eliminated, leading to more people without work and no financial support, pushing families further into a state of not having enough money. Those who grow crops and small businesses can no longer afford to take out loans, forcing them to produce less or shut down completely.",Customers can choose any of these possibilities.,D
How could the variety of different countries and governments around the world affect the reasons for getting involved in other nations' conflicts or crises?,"The world's political stage is controlled by a pattern of thinking that values human security, which is based on key beliefs about what it means to be secure, and which goes beyond cultural or political differences.","People from different political groups, with contrasting cultural, moral, and religious beliefs, agree that helping others in need can sometimes be the right thing to do.","Different countries have varied views, beliefs, and ways of life, leading to significant disagreements on how countries should govern themselves and interact with one another. To preserve this variety, there are guidelines that prevent interference in a country's self-governance, such as intervention for humanitarian reasons.","There are many conflicting perspectives around the world on how countries should govern themselves and their relationships with other countries. In order to preserve this variety of viewpoints, there is a necessity for shared principles regarding humanitarian aid and involvement.",C
What are the financial goals that the International Monetary Fund aims to achieve through its adjustment policies?,Lowering the value of currency to boost sales abroad and decrease demand for purchased goods from overseas by making them more expensive.,"Strict measures to control the amount of money in circulation, including raising borrowing costs, to decrease overall spending, and thus spending on imported goods; to slow down or decrease the rate of price increases.",Let's consider all the available possibilities.,The government is spending less money to reduce the amount of money it owes and slow down the increase in debt.,C
How far have living organisms been turned into weapons?,"Many soldiers think that most germs can stay strong enough to be used as a weapon. It would not require many resources, as the same equipment used to make vaccines could be used to make weapons instead, and a small amount of the germs would be enough to kill many people, making them a powerful and efficient weapon.","Desarrollo de métodos para propagar enfermedades en guerras se ha centrado en usar insectos como piojos, pulgas o mosquitos, ya que el enemigo tendría dificultades para controlar el origen del brote, sobrecargando sus sistemas de salud.","Living microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, as well as poisonous substances, are considered potential harmful materials. However, not every illness has the potential to be an effective weapon against humans. The way these materials can be stored, transported, how they spread, and their ability to survive various conditions can determine the impact they have on a targeted group of people.","Widespread vaccination against naturally occurring illnesses has eliminated the potential for viruses to cause a worldwide epidemic. The ability to vaccinate has weakened arguments for using viruses as weapons, as most health officials have measures in place to handle a possible outbreak.",C
"What are the key differences between the approach taken by Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde's group and the approach taken by the Critical Security Studies group when studying issues related to safety and protection?","The ideas and understanding behind each approach fundamentally clash. While Critical Security Studies challenges established structures and systems, the Copenhagen School is based on a view that knowledge can be objectively observed and measured.","While some believe that security is a concept shaped by ever-changing human ideas and perceptions, others view it as a tangible matter that can be studied impartially based on facts and observations.","Society has different understandings of what safety means. On one hand, safety can be seen as a clearly measurable condition that can be studied through direct observation and data collection. On the other hand, it can be viewed as a concept shaped by social factors, making objective study impossible.",The experts' theories do not consider how society evolves over time and how that affects what we view as threats.,A
What types of very destructive bombs work by splitting heavy atoms?,"Splitting nuclear weapons are like a gun that only needs a small amount of specialized uranium material to create a big blast because mass and energy can switch roles within the barrel. However, crushing nuclear weapons cannot maintain the reaction; the starter mechanism gets destroyed in the explosion, preventing the mass and energy swap.","Compressing certain materials using explosives to trigger an intense reaction is relatively simple because unlike the alternative method, it utilizes shaped explosive charges to compress the reactive material to the required level. However, the detonation process is highly unstable and carries a significant risk of reaching an uncontrolled state.","Regular weapons work by quickly mixing hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen together in a closed space, where they hit each other at high speeds, creating enough heat through friction to cause a powerful burst.","Handheld weapons have a tough structure, firing two smaller pieces at extreme speeds down a barrel, highly likely to cause an explosive reaction. More intricate devices require arranging shaped explosive materials to compress the reactive core with precise timing to trigger an explosion.",D
How is the disease HIV/AIDS considered a threat that goes beyond traditional military or political concerns?,HIV/AIDS is a recently discovered sickness that did not exist until near the end of the 1900s.,"Poor physical condition can endanger a nation in an indirect way, but it can also put important things like the economic system at risk.",A new way of thinking is needed to understand how the huge spread of HIV/AIDS affects safety.,"HIV/AIDS is more accurately described as a normal security concern, rather than the options presented.",B
Why is it important to promote the act of reducing the level of threat associated with an issue?,To stop freedoms that people currently have from being taken away or reduced by ending exceptional allowances and removing unique privileges.,To stop things from staying the same in the security field and make it easier to identify and deal with new or more pressing dangers that threaten our existence.,"To stop making minor issues seem like major threats, and to question whether the issues currently seen as threats are real threats or not.",To make sure those in charge think about security threats as problems that can be solved by taking extreme actions.,A
What is the best way to describe the practice of treating something as a medical issue or illness?,A matter involving health is treated as a major threat or security concern through the medicalization process.,Portraying issues through the lens of medical terminology is the result of discussions around national safety that frame threats or risks using language from the medical field.,"A matter is considered to be treated as a health problem when it is disregarded as a threat to safety and security, and instead viewed solely as a medical concern unrelated to safety.",Social problems are increasingly being viewed and addressed as issues related to health and treated with medical solutions.,D
In what ways have ideas about how health relates to safety changed over the 1900s?,"Living well has long been seen as something that affects safety and protection. Over the past 100 years, there was a growing feeling of worry about the possible harm of a major widespread disease outbreak in the world that has become more interconnected. Improvements in medicine and a number of successful efforts to limit the spread of outbreaks have mostly put these worries to rest.","There has been increasing awareness, since the early 1900s, of the achievements in medical and technological progress that have the capability to keep diseases that can spread from person to person under control among people living today.","Health crises that spread globally are a recent problem for safety and stability, becoming an issue only in the early 1800s. As a result, people across the world are still developing and trying out new approaches to manage and reduce the effects of widespread illnesses on safety.","People who studied safety in the 1900s were more worried about nuclear wars and military fights. As those fears lessened, there have been several widespread illnesses, and concerns are rising about the effects of more serious sicknesses spreading in a world with more movement of people.",D
What situation or events have led to the development of studying peace as an area of research?,"Efforts to study how to achieve peace grew in popularity after World War II because the existing political approaches failed to stop global conflict after World War I. At first, the study focused on the nuclear weapons race and tensions between Western and Eastern nations during the Cold War era, but it soon expanded to include environmental issues and the divide between wealthy and poor nations.","After the intense rivalry between major world powers ended, the study of security matters expanded to cover areas like environmental risks, social issues, and economic stability. As an academic field, peace studies tends to focus on the perspectives of European nations and wealthier countries.","The study of finding ways to establish peace arose as a reaction to countries gaining the ability to develop nuclear weapons during the period of ongoing tension and hostility between the Western and Eastern blocs. The goal of this field is to keep countries safe, and it achieves this by examining the buildup of weapons. This field particularly concentrates on the competition between the West and the East to accumulate more nuclear weapons.","Peace studies looks at differences in how wealth and resources are shared across the world, with the goal of promoting peace by making sure these resources are distributed fairly.",A
Rephrased question: Which of these statements is widely seen as a real advantage of the process of turning assets into financial products that can be traded?,Presenting something as a major threat encourages prompt action and sustained commitment of political backing and resources.,Bundling related issues into groups promotes more effective problem-solving.,Making issues seem like threats and calling them important for safety gains public backing for those issues and leads to more resources being devoted to them.,"Here are a few different ways to say that statement without using any technical language or jargon:

You can choose any of those possibilities.

Those are all valid choices.

Feel free to pick whichever of those selections works best.",D
How could a community be put in danger?,The identity and culture of a community are put in danger when their languages and long-held customs are challenged. The inability to use and nurture the language they have always spoken leads to the breakdown of that community.,"When a community feels that their shared sense of belonging is challenged, it can lead to situations where people's ability to express themselves is limited and the community's ability to pass on their way of life to future generations is disrupted.",Social groups face dangers from outside forces attempting to limit population growth and discourage the passing down of cultural identities to future generations.,"People moving into a new place causes changes in the makeup of the people living there, leading to rivalry between different groups or competition for limited resources. This is not an immediate danger to life but part of larger, uncontrollable processes of how groups of people evolve over time.",B
What option best explains the ideas of a company's public image and how it is viewed by the community?,"A person can have only one personal identity, which serves as the foundation for developing other identities. On the other hand, a person may have multiple professional or organizational identities that vary in significance.","A company's established identity refers to its true, innate character. An external identity refers to the meanings the company associates with itself while considering the viewpoints of others. A company can have multiple external identities.",An organization's distinct character is shaped through its dealings with other entities within the global community.,"Belonging to a certain group or having a specific role in society shapes how a person sees themselves and acts. Similar to a company's brand or image, a person's sense of identity comes from their interactions with others and is not something inherent within them.",B
How have disagreements or disputes been an issue on the agenda to protect the environment for powerful nations?,"Changes in the natural world can lead to conflicts between nations, mainly focused on the lack of resources linked to disputes. There is a significant connection between the decline of the environment and acts of violence; resources as desired goals and as means to an end may result in violence if there is unfairness.","Human population increase and its impact on damaging the environment can result in conflicts caused by environmental issues. Thus, there is a direct connection between human population growth and changes in the environment, and environmental changes are the main factor driving violence.","Research groups looking into environmental conflicts have not been able to find measurable connections between environmental and social factors and the reasons for war. Studying combined data did not reveal a shared underlying cause. The sheer number of potential factors involved was simply too large, preventing any clear link from being established.","Regular research shows that powerful nations tend to have fewer violent internal conflicts, while countries going through major economic and political changes are more likely to experience violent conflicts. Environmental changes are unlikely to directly cause wars but can contribute to the situation.",D
"If something goes wrong or stops working properly, how would you categorize it according to the three types mentioned?","Protective measures were not strong enough to defend the system from an unauthorized group's harmful activities, leading to the loss of private information.","The instructions inside the computer program are incorrect, leading to poor functioning of the overall system.",You can choose any of the given possibilities.,"The computer network has stopped working because of an unpredictable natural disaster, such as a huge wave that damages essential electronics.",B
What could make a country want to become part of a group like NATO?,Stronger countries may also form partnerships to provide security for weaker allied countries.,Countries might want to become part of a group if they feel that what they have is not enough to protect their independence and keep them safe.,A group of countries might find it appealing to form an alliance when a potentially dominant power poses a threat to the other countries in that region or system.,"Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon without changing the meaning:

Each of the available choices.",D
How can vulnerable countries protect themselves from potential threats while not appearing aggressive or provoking conflict?,"When the ruling authority fails to maintain order, different groups in society fight to protect their interests, leading to widespread insecurity. This situation sustains itself - a lasting state of growing chaos because actions taken to maintain power will trigger more opposition.","The weakness of an entity leads to a situation where it feels threatened by others, which prompts actions to improve its position, inadvertently causing instability in its surroundings.","Individuals and groups in a society with a fragile government compete to safeguard their security and interests. However, the ruling authorities face a challenge: using force to restore order may undermine their ability to govern effectively.","People feel insecure when there is no strong central authority with the sole power to enforce laws and maintain order. However, using military force to bolster government institutions may prevent this situation from worsening. Turning to violence can reverse the failure to establish a stable governing system. Social unrest represents a state of disorder that falls short of complete anarchy but has the potential to escalate.",A
How does someone's personal beliefs and views shape their understanding of the world around them?,"Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: Ideas and beliefs are important and matter as much as, if not more than, physical objects and resources.",People's individuality and sense of self are meaningful.,A state of disorder and lack of authority is an unavoidable characteristic of the relationships between different nations.,Individuals and organizations shape and influence each other.,C
Who were the thinkers whose ideas and philosophies formed the basis of the study of how economic factors influence social and historical events?,"Barry Buzan and Ole Waever introduced a way to look at security that goes beyond just military threats and includes things like political, economic, environmental, and societal issues.",Two well-known scholars who studied and wrote about international relations and the dynamics between nations.,Two philosophers and thinkers who proposed a radically different economic and social system challenged the practices of their time.,"Early thinkers who studied how goods and services are created, traded, and used differed in their beliefs about the role of individuals and society in economic matters.",C
What rules or choices do leaders have to maintain order and safety within their group?,"Powerful people discourage opposition to the ruling system through punishments. They deprive those in power of resources, weapons, and access to trade routes as a way of weakening their authority and influence.","Those in power in countries with limited resources and public support often have to use force. However, a major problem is that the forces needed to maintain control can themselves become a danger to those in charge, requiring the intentional weakening of armed groups.","People in power try to promote a new way of viewing one's sense of belonging, where feelings of ethnic identity are replaced by beliefs centered around the regime's false narrative.",Countries without much power have sought help from other nations and have started making their systems more democratic in order to gain approval from their own people as well as from the global community.,B
Can defensive planning and discouraging tactics be helpful for protecting against cyber threats?,"No, limiting weapons does not have any usefulness beyond conventional combat tools.","Effective methods to limit and discourage harmful actions have worked well when applied to different areas of security, such as strategies to control and prevent the use of nuclear weapons.","All groups must work together to stop harmful activities, which sounds good on paper, but ensuring everyone follows the rules is nearly impossible when it comes to online attacks and conflicts.","People cannot agree on joint ways of behaving, so preventing war through the threat of retaliation has not worked; the only solution without issues is limiting weapons.",C
How do a country's views on violent extremist groups impact the actions they will take against them?,"People who are sick often receive treatments from the government to make a dangerous group look less appealing. However, these treatments may encourage the dangerous group to keep acting violently because they feel like they are being rewarded. In these situations, the treatments may become agreements that fuel the violence rather than stopping it. It's also clear that these treatments may not get rid of the dangerous group completely.","Actions taken against terrorism lately have been influenced by the idea of a war on terror, where payback and punishment are seen as acceptable. This view allows for preemptive strikes against training camps, headquarters, financial sources, and even the killing of important individuals.","Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: Although the comparison to battle assumes stopping something before it happens, stopping something before it happens is more crucial to a legal system. The ability to act before a typical crime takes place is limited to holding suspected individuals or bothering them through legal means.","Reactions to attacks by violent extremists can take different forms, either directly or indirectly, depending on whether the attacks are viewed as acts of war, criminal activities, or public health emergencies.",D
How could the length of time one spends in an educational system be measured?,"The study of strategy as a separate field arose from the United States and later spread to Europe. It started in the US and was adopted by Europe later on. In Europe, the study of security matters relied heavily on theories and concepts developed elsewhere.","The research organizations became regular producers of limited specific problem-solving approaches, falling into 'busy data collection': the core reason for its main contribution (discouragement) no longer held true.","Peace studies progressed simultaneously but independently, and its unique critical division was not considered a part of security studies by either its own proponents or the security studies field.",You have several choices available.,D
How can the dangers of diseases spreading from person to person be looked at when thinking about a country's overall safety?,"The well-being of soldiers is a top priority when it comes to national defense strategies, and illnesses can spread more easily due to the challenging physical and social environments that military personnel face, especially during active combat situations.","The natural human fear of tiny organisms makes them easy to present not only as significant health problems, but also as dangers to the entire nation's safety.","Illnesses that are normally found in specific parts of the world, due to how they spread or for reasons related to people's living conditions, are increasingly seen by countries as possible dangers because of the increasing connections between nations.",Here is the statement rephrased to remove technical terms and jargon: You can choose any of those possibilities.,D
How do private groups or associations help with the buying and selling of military equipment and services across different countries?,Groups that are not part of any government play a leading role in current efforts to control and regulate weapons.,Charitable or private groups lack the means and knowledge needed to create useful rules or take action on controlling weapons.,Groups not related to governments have had an important and successful part in creating rules and limits around weapons in recent times.,There is a significant lack of participation from groups or individuals not associated with governments in regulating the worldwide sale and exchange of military equipment and weapons.,C

How can we best explain the meaning of positive change and growth when discussing the world becoming more interconnected?,"A successful life is when people have the means to live without worries or lack of essential needs, and they can live without constant fear or risk of it ending unexpectedly.",A country is seen as developed when it has reached certain economic and political levels that are expected by other countries in the world; the standard for what counts as a 'developed' country is set by the requirements to participate and interact with other countries.,"Advancing progress is a way to tackle the unfairness that comes with open global markets. In this case, progress means a group's capacity to effectively use what they have and improve how they make and share things, leading to fairer income distribution within that society.","The way people in a community think and the values they believe in are shaped by the ideas and principles they follow. In today's interconnected world, this often means adopting the Western beliefs of democracy, freedom of choice, and a market-driven economy.",C
"How would you explain the concept of favoring or prioritizing European culture, history, and values over others?","Looking at things mainly from a European perspective, and measuring other societies against European standards, to judge which one is better, without being impartial.","Looking at other cultures through a biased European perspective, where the measuring stick used for judging non-European societies is based on European cultural beliefs and prejudices.",Eurocentrism refers to examining or analyzing only European political or economic structures while ignoring or overlooking other regions and cultures.,These choices allow for various possibilities.,B

How could big differences between rich and poor countries put the safety of people around the world at risk?,"People's safety is at risk due to unfair distribution of wealth worldwide, because three-fifths of the world's population do not experience the advantages of increased global connectivity and integration. However, this unequal situation does not lead to political unrest or armed conflict.","People around the world who do not have equal opportunities and resources compared to others feel unhappy with their situations, but they do not have the power or ability to fight against it or speak out in disagreement.",People who have been ignored or treated unfairly by the current global economic system can become angry and fight against those who have gained from the policies that have hurt them; revolts and uprisings are likely to happen.,People's unequal economic situations around the world do not pose a major risk to the safety and well-being of everyone on Earth.,C
What lies ahead for extremely destructive and harmful weapons?,"The ability of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention to serve as a solid foundation in global rules to stop the spread of chemical and biological weapons is questionable. The effort to prevent the illegal trade of materials related to chemical and nuclear weapons through the Proliferation Security Initiative is also an incomplete approach. While they may be useful for diplomatic discussions, these agreements lack the necessary political backing to create an organization with the power to enforce the control and use of these weapons.","Countries are no longer following the agreed-upon rules and regulations for controlling and limiting the spread of extremely destructive weapons. This has happened because some countries are trying to make their own powerful weapons, which goes against the norms that were established. We can see this in the tension and disagreements that arose after India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998, and also when the United States Senate decided not to approve the treaty that would have banned all nuclear testing.","People's current worries have reduced because the threat of weapons of mass destruction has greatly decreased after the Cold War ended. Many Soviet (Russian) and US nuclear weapons that were ready for use have been taken out of service, removing the threat of a massive nuclear war.","Groups with powerful destructive capabilities pose a danger that current policies and military forces struggle to address. The idea of retaliating against an initial attack is outdated because it's difficult to identify such groups, and preventing attacks is ineffective since their motives are often driven by political, ideological, or religious beliefs.",D
How do the views on identity in world affairs differ between those who see it as an objective reality and those who see it as created through social interactions?,"People's beliefs and behaviors shape our understanding of international relationships, including how different groups see themselves. On the other hand, the realist view sees countries as acting and reacting based on their situation.",The realist approach views how individuals or groups see themselves as very important in interactions between different nations or groups. The theory assumes that the way an individual or group perceives their identity influences their actions.,"People who believe in realism think that things happen because of causes and effects, while those who believe in social constructivism think that our understanding of who we are comes from the shared meanings and interactions between individuals.","Those who believe social factors shape reality see the nation as an independent entity whose actions are influenced by the demands of the global environment, while those who focus on objective facts view interactions between nations as a natural result of self-discovery.",C

"In the view of those who study language and society, which of these effects of studying security matters is the most significant?",Academic work in the field of security helps expand knowledge and deepen conceptual grasp of the topic.,Writing about war and conflict examines the past events of battles between countries and groups.,Security studies teaches young people about the truth behind fighting and planning for war.,"Studies on safety and protection create and continue spreading ideas that influence conflicts, deciding what is acceptable, favoring some people and groups while pushing others aside.",D
How can the distinct connection between American and European studies about safety be clarified?,"People have different views on the idea of security: in Europe, the discussion remains focused on the personal beliefs of those studying security; whereas in the US, defining the concept of security is seen as a necessary but basic task.","People in the US value knowledge that is based on logical reasoning, while in Europe, knowledge is valued more when it involves deep contemplation and reflection. In the US, discussions around security studies typically examine hypotheses as relationships of cause and effect, linking them to broader debates and measuring intangible factors.","The different major competing explanations in the US focused, on one side, the US's leading global influence, and, on the other side, the stability based solely on power resulting from the presumed lack of any other major power in the world, making it impossible for other nations to counterbalance the US's dominance.","Here is the rephrased statement without technical terms and jargon:

How have studies focused on women's perspectives and critical examinations in the 1980s and 1990s broadened our knowledge about security matters related to gender?,"Women are often impacted negatively by government policies related to war and security, as they may face harm or violence during armed conflicts or in the aftermath, as a result of social conditions and gender roles.",Consequences related to gender roles and identities have not challenged the established theories about how nations interact with each other. Theories that view the state as a constructed idea rather than a fixed entity gained wider acceptance without questioning the ideas of the state being the primary source of military might or the highest form of organized human society.,"Studying different perspectives reveals that wars can have distinct impacts on men and women. Acknowledging these distinct impacts has enabled us to address societal expectations for men and women's roles in conflicts, and has influenced how we think about, engage with, and object to those expected roles.","Women's writings from the 1980s and 1990s mainly highlighted how women had been used to promote nationalist causes, emphasizing their role as child-bearers, but lacked critical examination.",C
How can a country protect its people from possible harmful acts before they happen?,People usually think of preventing terrorism as if it were a war or a crime. All governments will try to stop it (which terrorists see as oppression) by arresting or getting rid of those directly involved in the violence. Security forces either go after the terrorists before they attack (like a war) or arrest them after the attack (like a crime).,"Groups involved in violent extremism are difficult to infiltrate, as they are tightly connected and have a well-organized structure. In both military conflicts and criminal investigations, information is gathered through two methods: extracting details from captured individuals or relying on someone within the group to provide information. A successful intelligence operation greatly increases the chances of disrupting the group's violent activities once its core has been exposed.","Stopping terrorism is a very debated plan aimed at reducing the attractiveness of terrorism among people through reform measures. This approach involves talks between countries. However, as a preventative method, it has been questioned and is said to resemble giving in to demands.","Securing important buildings and locations, like government buildings or cultural landmarks, helps to safeguard vulnerable individuals. However, if the security measures make it harder for attackers to target these locations, they may shift their efforts to less protected areas, making it more challenging to maintain safety.",A
How can we differentiate between a small amount of force and maximum force?,"When trying to put pressure on another country, there is a difference between using a little bit of force and using all-out force. The second step in putting pressure on another country is making this distinction. Putting pressure on another country only fails if the country doing the pressuring does not achieve what it wanted to achieve and does not overpower its opponent in the second step.","Typically, there is no major difference between using extreme force and limited force. Using air or naval forces is just as forceful as a traditional ground attack. Military action always happens when talks break down, and the situation shifts from diplomacy to armed conflict.","Separating the use of measured action from excessive force matters because the level of pressure applied determines the final result. If a beneficial outcome occurs, then we can say that measured action was employed.","Separating small acts of violence from large-scale conflict is important because resorting to overwhelming power means that negotiation has broken down. The difference doesn't lie in the level or kind of violence, but in the goal behind using force and whether the other side has any choice left. Fundamentally, small acts of violence are a means of leverage.",D
What difficulties might we face when trying to keep people and places safe in the years to come?,"The biggest shared worry in the 2000s was fear and safety, but quickly growing worries over the environment and climate change could easily become another major connecting concern.",The future significance of security-related research depends on its capacity to prevail in the broader discussions within the field of international relations. It is highly improbable that the ongoing internal theoretical debates will result in a dominant position for any of the current perspectives.,"Experts from the United States and Europe will study the impact of technology, worldwide connections, societal risks, and the global economy. This scenario suggests that there will be many areas where currently separate theoretical concepts interconnect.","Here is the rephrased statement:
