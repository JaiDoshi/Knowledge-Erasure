"X = stationary autoregressive process
Y = shocks

For an X, Y will",Eventually die away,Persist indefinitely,Grow exponentially,Never occur,A
"X = AR(1) model
Y = disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
Z = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut

Consider the following X with the Y

yt = Z

The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by",0.2,0.4,0.5,0.33,D
"X = test statistic
Y = p-value
Z = null hypothesis

Suppose that an X has associated with it a Y of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?

(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the Z

(ii) The Z would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used

(iii) The Z would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used

(iv) The Z would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.",(ii) and (iv) only,(i) and (iii) only,"(i), (ii), and (iii) only","(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)",C
"X = OLS estimator
Y = heteroscedasticity

What would be the consequences for the X if Y is present in a regression model but ignored?",It will be biased,It will be inconsistent,It will be inefficient,"All of (a), (b) and (c) will be true.",C
"X = bi-variate VAR
Y = determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals
Z = Akaike's information criterion

Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for an X. 500 observations are available for the X, and the values of the Y are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What is the optimal model order according to Z?",1 lag,2 lags,3 lags,4 lags,C
