Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a species of goose.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: So, this goose species nests on both cliffs and beaches near the ocean. After hatching, all the chicks need to make their way to the ocean.
Person 2: I see. What's the issue with that?
Person 1: Well, the chicks from cliff nests have to tumble down the cliff to reach the ocean, and many of them die from the fall. So, which of the following would be most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is actually adaptive for this goose species?",Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.,Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.,Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.,More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.,B

Person 1: Hey, have you heard about the recent theory explaining the unusual rise in asthma attacks after thunderstorms?

Person 2: Interesting. And how do these starch granules relate to asthma attacks?
Person 1: The theory states that the starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack.
Person 2: That's quite fascinating. So, if this theory is true, which of the following statements would be correct?",The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.,The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.,The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.,The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.,B
