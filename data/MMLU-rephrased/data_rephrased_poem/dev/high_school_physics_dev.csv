"Conservation or Chaos?
Whirling, spinning, 'round and 'round,
What conditions must be found?
Linear momentum, a clue to hold,
Or net external force, left untold?
Torque, the culprit to behold,
Conserving angular, the tale to unfold.
Which will ensure the dance endures?
The answer lies in nature's pure.",I and II only,I and III only,II and III only,III only,D
"At the pipe's closed end,
The wave's properties bend.
A node, it shall prevail,
Where pressure does not fail.","The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode.","The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node.",The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes.,The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.,B
"Photocell's work, a puzzle to unfold,
Powered by the sun's rays, its story untold.
Frequency f, a trillion Hertz so bright,
Shining on the metal plate, a beacon of light.

Power P, a hundred Watts, a force to behold,
Lighting up the circuit, its tale yet to be told.
What current flows through the resistor, a question to address,
Revealing the secrets of this photocell's quest.",2:00 AM,6:00 AM,12:00 AM,24 A,D
"Pulsing electromagnetic waves,
Harnessing power with grace,
Channeling energy through the maze,
Illuminating the space.

Voltage, a constant force,
Current, the flow's own course,
Intertwined in a synchronous dance,
Powering the microwave's advance.

The rate of energy, a vital key,
Unlocking the oven's efficiency,
Transforming time and sustenance,
A symphony of culinary elegance.",10 W,30 W,60 W,240 W,D
"Charge at the origin, fixed and true,
A point charge, Q = +1 mC, what to do?
Move another charge, Q = +8 ÂµC, with care,
From (0, 4 meters) to (3 meters, 0), the pair.
How much work is needed, a question to ponder,
As the charges interact and the distance wander.
A journey of potential, a dance of force,
Revealing the work required, of course.",3.5 J,6.0 J,22.5 J,40 J,B
