Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat’s suggestion:",It is too computationally expensive.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.,C
