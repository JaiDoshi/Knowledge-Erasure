Z = 100 cm

An X consists of two Y separated by Z. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the X is",4,5,6,20,A
"X = thermodynamic processes
Y = internal energy
Z = ideal gas

For which of the following X is the increase in the Y of a Z equal to the heat added to the gas?",Constant temperature,Constant volume,Constant pressure,Adiabatic,B
"X = length of the first Nichrome wire
Y = cross-sectional area of the first Nichrome wire
Z = electric potential of the free end of the longer wire

One end of a Nichrome wire of length X and cross-sectional area Y is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length X/2 and cross-sectional area 2Y. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of Z volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to",2.4 V,3.3 V,4.5 V,5.7 V,A
