In the library of dreams, she found solace among the pages of forgotten stories and whispered secrets.
Beneath the canopy of twinkling lights, they shared stories and laughter around the crackling campfire, their spirits alight with camaraderie.

A world unto itself, it appears.
What secrets does it hold, we wonder,
As we delve into its depths, with cheer.

Its elements stand apart, a school.
Closed under addition and multiplication,
A realm of mathematical elation.

Revealing the traits that we adore.
Uncover the essence, the heart of 2Z,
And the wonders it holds, for all to see.",0,3,12,30,A
