"A Poet's Response:

Voices echo, words take flight,
A protest born, a battle to ignite.
A student's act, a flag sewn with pride,
Defiance flaunted, a right to abide.

Yet, a law stands tall, a shield of might,
Criminalizing speech, a chilling sight.
The student's anger, a cry for change,
Confronted by a statute, its scope so strange.

The strongest argument, a beacon of light,
Shines on the freedom of speech, a fundamental right.
A challenge to the state, a battle to be won,
For the student's voice, a fight has just begun.",the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.,the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment.,the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.,the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and FourteenthAmendments.,D
"Beneath the state's new decree,
A man's disposal dreams, now set free.
Contracts bind, yet laws hold sway,
Leaving him to face a legal fray.

With standing firm, he must now debate,
The strongest grounds to challenge this fate.
What constitutional grounds will he assert?
A question that leaves his future unstirred.",The commerce clause.,The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,"The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. ",The contract clause.,A
"Judicial Witness, a subtle dance,
Facts ascertained, a courtroom's advance.
Yet, some truths evade this discerning eye,
Eluding the judge's watchful reply.
What kind of fact cannot be so addressed?
A puzzle to ponder, a mystery to test.",Indisputable facts.,Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations.,Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge.,Facts capable of scientific verification.,B
"A Tale of Restricted Land
Within a rural county's expanse,
A developer's grand plan did dance.
Drafted on that October day,
Restrictions ruled the land's sway.

Utility firms claimed their right,
A strip of ten feet, day and night.
No structure could on it be built,
A rule the landowners now felt.

Years passed, new owners came and went,
Deeds referenced the plan's intent.
A retiree, a teacher, a librarian,
Each built their homes, unaware of the ban.

The librarian, with post and rail,
Fenced the land, without fail.
The teacher, though, did now object,
Seeking justice, the fence to eject.

Will the court compel the fence's fall?
Or will the developer's plan stand tall?
A tale of restricted land unfolds,
Where property rights are","grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. ","grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. ","deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. ","deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as ""a structure"" within the terms of the restriction. ",B
"A debt to pay, a son in need,
A father's love, a promise to heed.
Five thousand dollars, a burden to bear,
The father steps in, a weight to share.

A contract signed, a payment plan laid,
Ten monthly installments, the debt to be paid.
The creditor, silent, no promise to hold,
Yet, the father's payments, faithfully told.

For five months they flowed, the debt reduced,
The son's liability, the creditor excused.
But then, the father, his promise now broken,
Refuses to pay, the deal now spoken.

What argument strong, can the creditor make,
To hold the father, his pledge to uphold, to take?
A legal bond, a moral duty too,
The father's liability, what does the law construe?","The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. ","Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. ","The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. ","By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration.
