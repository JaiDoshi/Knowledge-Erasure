Side two, once, a fleeting chime.

Side three, twice, a modest sum,
Side four, thrice, a stronger hum.
Side five, four times, a steady pace,
Side six, five times, takes the lead's race.

From these results, we ponder and seek,
The probability of side three to speak.

The Conundrum of Decision Tree
Shall we divide or shall we split?
A binary choice, a threshold to fit?
Or a multiway path, each value a route,
Distinct choices, a diverse shout.

The question lingers, what shall we do?
The traditional way, or Pat's view?
The biggest problem, a choice to make,
A decision that our model shall take.",It is too computationally expensive.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.,C
