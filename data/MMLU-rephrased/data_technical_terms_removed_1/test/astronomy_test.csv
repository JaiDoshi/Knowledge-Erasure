What led researchers to believe that the planet Mars had a hotter and more water-filled environment in the past?,Mars shows evidence of significant volcanism which implies that the climate was once warmer and therefore wetter,early observations showed what appeared to be changing vegetation patterns and canals indicating the presence of water,there are many geologic features on Mars that are difficult to explain unless liquid water was once stable at the surface,all planets tend to begin with warm wet climates and gradually become cold and dry with smaller planets cooling faster than larger planets,C
How do scientists believe the planet Jupiter produces its own warmth from within?,nuclear fusion in the core,by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy,internal friction due to its high rotation rate,chemical processes,B
Which one of these groups of stars is not found along the cloudy band in the night sky?,Perseus,Cygnus,Scorpius,Leo,D
