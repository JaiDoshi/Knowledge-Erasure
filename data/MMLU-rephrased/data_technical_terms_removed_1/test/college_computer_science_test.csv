"If a tool looks for words in a list, it does the following. A table with yes or no values has been created, with all values set to no at first. A process has been used to represent each word in the list as a value, and for each word in the list, the matching value in the table has been set to yes. To check if a new set of words contains words from the list, the same process is used to represent each new word as a value, and the matching value in the table is checked. Which of these is (are) right? I. Yes means the word was in the list. II. No means the word was not in the list. III.
