"A certain system has 8 spaces labeled R0, R1, . . . , R7, and it supports the following actions: Add the values in two spaces and put the sum in another space, and Multiply the values in two spaces and put the product in another space. An action normally takes one cycle, but it takes two cycles if the result is needed by the next action in a sequence. Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where A, B, C are located in spaces R0, R1, R2.
