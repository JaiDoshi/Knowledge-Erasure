Hey, I have a question about linear regression and AdaBoost.

What about them?

Well, I have two statements. First, is it true that the linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators?

Hey, I've got a question about clustering spatial data.

Oh, what's the question?

Well, let's say we want to cluster geometrical locations of houses into many different sizes and shapes. Which clustering method do you think would be most appropriate for that?

Hmm, that's an interesting question. There are quite a few clustering algorithms out there. What are some of the key things you're looking for in the clustering results?

I want the method to be able to produce clusters of varying sizes and shapes, since the houses may be laid out in irregular patterns. Does that help narrow it down?",Decision Trees,Density-based clustering,Model-based clustering,K-means clustering,B
