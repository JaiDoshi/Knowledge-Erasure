"Let's say you have a certain result from a study. Based on this result, which one of the following statements is correct?

(i) If we consider 8% as a threshold for determining something, we would not be able to decide between choosing one option or the other

(ii) If we use 10% as the threshold, we would choose the first option

(iii) If we use 1% as the threshold, we would choose the second option

"Imagine a researcher wants to find the best way to model a situation involving two variables that influence each other over time. They have 500 data points. The researcher looks at how well different models fit the data, considering models with 1, 2, 3, or 4 time lags. The measure of goodness-of-fit is 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for models with 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags, respectively. Which model, based on a widely-used criterion, would be considered the best one to use?",One delay.,A period of delay or slowness in progress.,The current situation is behind by three intervals.,Delayed impacts from four previous time periods.,C
