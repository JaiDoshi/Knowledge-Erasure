Defensive Realism and Offensive Realism,
Divergent paths, each with its own reason.

Globalization's grip, he sought to untie,
In 2016, on the campaign trail, he'd cry.
""America first,"" his rallying call,
Protectionism, his answer to all.

Trade deals, he'd decry, as unfair and unjust,
Promising to renegotiate, to regain our trust.
Tariffs and barriers, his weapons of choice,
To shield us from the world, was his resounding voice.

The world, he deemed, had taken our jobs and our might,
