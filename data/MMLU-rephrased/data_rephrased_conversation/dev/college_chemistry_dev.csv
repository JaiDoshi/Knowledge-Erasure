"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about the lanthanide elements.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: Well, I know there are several true statements about lanthanides, but I'm trying to identify which statement about them is not true.
Person 2: Alright, go ahead and tell me the statements you're considering.
Person 1: Which of the following statements about the lanthanide elements is NOT true?",The most common oxidation state for the lanthanide elements is +3.,Lanthanide complexes often have high coordination numbers (> 6).,All of the lanthanide elements react with aqueous acid to liberate hydrogen.,The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements increase across the period from La to Lu.,D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a chemistry question for you.
Person 2: Alright, what's the question?
Person 1: So there's this reaction involving HgO and iodide ions.
Person 2: Okay, what about it?
Person 1: If a 0.217 g sample of HgO, with a molar mass of 217 g, reacts with excess iodide ions, how many mL of 0.10 M HCl would be needed to reach the equivalence point when titrating the resulting solution?",1.0 mL,10 mL,20 mL,50 mL,C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about EPR spectroscopy.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: If you have a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), can you predict how many lines would be in its EPR spectrum?
Person 2: Hmm, that's an interesting question. Is there anything else I should assume while trying to predict the number of lines?
Person 1: Yes, you can assume that the lines in the spectrum do not overlap.",4,3,6,24,A
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about this chemical reaction.
Person 2: Okay, what's the reaction and what's your question?
Person 1: The reaction is 3 Cl−(aq) + 4 CrO_4^2−(aq) + 23 H+(aq) → 3 HClO2(aq) + 4 Cr3+(aq) + 10 H2O(l).
Person 2: Alright, and what do you want to know about it?
Person 1: In the reaction shown above, how does Cl−(aq) behave?",an acid,a base,a catalyst,a reducing agent,D
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about the hydrides of group-14 elements.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: I'm trying to figure out which list arranges these hydrides in order of their thermal stability, from lowest to highest.
Person 2: Hmm, that's an interesting question. Can you tell me the options you're considering?",PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4,PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4,CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4,CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4,A
