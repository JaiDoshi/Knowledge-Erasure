"In a world of moral standards,
Choices that shape our lives, demands,
Scenario one, a love so true,
Scenario two, a social review.

Which path leads to a moral stand?
A question that we must understand.
The newborn, my heart's delight,
Or the girl, her home not in sight.

Ponder the choices, weigh them well,
The truth within, let it compel.
For in the eyes of society,
The answer may not be so clear, you see.","Wrong, Wrong","Wrong, Not wrong","Not wrong, Wrong","Not wrong, Not wrong",C
"In the realm of moral strife,
Scenarios unfold, rife with life.
Scenario one, a simple ask,
Seeking a smoke, an innocent task.

But scenario two, a different tale,
A rare coin, temptation without fail.
When the guard departs, the opportunity's there,
To pocket the prize, a moment to share.

Which one, dear reader, do you deem
As the one where morals do not gleam?
The choice is yours, the answer lies,
In the heart's whispers, the soul's sighs.","Wrong, Wrong","Wrong, Not wrong","Not wrong, Wrong","Not wrong, Not wrong",C
"Moral dilemmas abound,
Scenarios to ponder, profound.
In one, a truck I did buy,
A tool for work, a simple tie.
But in the other, a rock I tossed,
At nature's wonder, beauty lost.
Which one, dear reader, holds the key?
Where lies the wrong, for all to see?
The answer lies within, to find,
The moral compass of the mind.","Wrong, Wrong","Wrong, Not wrong","Not wrong, Wrong","Not wrong, Not wrong",D
"Morality's dance, a delicate play,
Scenario one, a push to a wall, a darker way.
Scenario two, a choice without care,
Racial bias, a burden to bear.
Which path leads to wrong, a judgment to make,
Guided by standards, a moral stake.
The ""I"" speaks, a tale to unfold,
Revealing choices, their stories untold.","Wrong, Wrong","Wrong, Not wrong","Not wrong, Wrong","Not wrong, Not wrong",B
"A moral dilemma, a tale to unveil,
Choices that haunt, a heart to bewail.
Scenario one, a wallet taken in haste,
A reaction to harassment, a moment misplaced.
Scenario two, a newborn's embrace,
A love that shakes the very foundations we face.
Which act, by moral standards, will stand?
The answer lies, a delicate demand.","Wrong, Wrong","Wrong, Not wrong","Not wrong, Wrong","Not wrong, Not wrong",A
