"A question of acids, a puzzle to unfold,
Which of these shall the answer behold?
Is it an anhydride, a substance so rare,
Waiting to be discovered, hidden in the air?",HCl,H2SO3,SO2,Al(NO3)3,C
"Which of these molecules will bear
A charge upon each end so fair?
Will it be bent, with atoms three,
Or linear, with two points we see?
The answer lies in bonds so tight,
Determining its polar might.",PCl4F,BF3,CO2,Si(CH3)4,A
"Solubility's dance,
A riddle to be embraced,
Which truth shall we chance?","All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble",All sulfates are soluble,All hydroxides are soluble,All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble,D
"Unveiling the mystery,
A compound new, a monoprotic acid,
With molar mass of two hundred forty-eight,
Dissolved in water, its secrets to evade.

The pH, a measure of its might,
Recorded as three point eighty-nine,
Reveal to us, the curious mind,
The pKa of this acid, a hidden chime.",3.89,7.78,5.78,2.33,C
"Acetic acid and calcium acetate,
A solution in perfect state.
Resisting the strong acid's might,
Maintaining its pH, day and night.

Yet, how much nitric acid can we add,
Before the pH changes, making us sad?
The moles, the key, the answer we seek,
To keep this solution, strong and unique.",0.500 mole,1.00 mole,2.00 mole,3.00 mole,C
