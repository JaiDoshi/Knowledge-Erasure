"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about fields and polynomial rings.
Person 2: Okay, what's the question?
Person 1: I'm trying to find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.
Person 2: Hmm, that's an interesting question. Let's think about this together.",0,1,2,3,B
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about factor groups and subgroups.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: Well, I have two statements. First, if aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. Is that true?
Person 2: Okay, and what's the second statement?
Person 1: If H and K are subgroups of G, then HK is a subgroup of G. Are both of these statements true?","True, True","False, False","True, False","False, True",B
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about group theory.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: Statement 1 says that every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group.
Person 2: Okay, and what about Statement 2?
Person 1: Statement 2 says that the symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.","True, True","False, False","True, False","False, True",C
"Person 1: Hey, I have a question about functions and groups.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: Well, I have two statements. First, every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. Second, every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian. Are both of these statements true?","True, True","False, False","True, False","False, True",A
