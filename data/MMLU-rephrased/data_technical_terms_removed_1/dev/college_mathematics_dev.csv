"Here is the question rephrased without technical terms and jargon: Suppose there is a collection of all mathematical expressions involving variables and numbers with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers. Let's call operations X and Y, where X takes one of these expressions and multiplies it by the variable, and Y takes the expression and finds how it changes as the variable increases. If we first do operation X and then operation Y on one of these expressions, which of the following statements is correct?",ST = 0,ST = T,ST = TS,ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.,D
"A container starts off with a mixture of 3 grams of a substance dissolved in 100 liters of water. Another mixture containing a smaller amount of the substance, specifically 0.02 grams per liter of water, is continuously added to the container at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The newly added mixture gets evenly spread out with the existing mixture in the container, and the combined mixture flows out of the container at the same rate of 4 liters per minute. If the spreading out happens instantly, how much of the substance in grams will be present in the container after 100 minutes?",2,2 - e^-2,2 + e^-2,2 + e^-4,D
"Let A be a square array of numbers with 2 rows and 2 columns. Which of the following statements must be true? I. All the numbers in the array formed by multiplying A with itself are not negative. II. The product of the top-left and bottom-right numbers minus the product of the top-right and bottom-left numbers in the array formed by multiplying A with itself is not negative. III. If A has two different numbers that satisfy a certain equation when multiplied by A, then the array formed by multiplying A with itself also has two different numbers that satisfy that equation when multiplied by the array.",I only,II only,III only,II and III only,B
"In a certain math rule, if you replace x with 1 + x, the result stays the same. If this rule can be written as a polynomial equation and when x is 5, the result is 11, what would the result be when x is 15/2?",-11,0,11,33/2,C
What is the largest negative number that you can get by adding together the two parts of any combination of whole numbers which solves the equation 7 times the first part plus 12 times the second part equals 22?,-5,-4,-3,-2,B
