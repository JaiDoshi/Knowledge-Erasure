Here is a poem that rephrases the question:

Kass and the notion of ""better off dead""
What does he find so incoherent, Gill has said?
A philosophical quandary, a puzzle to heed,
Exploring the depths of this life-or-death creed.
Is there truth in the claim that we're better expired?
Kass ponders this deeply, his insights required.
The answer, it seems, lies in the value of life,
A perspective that challenges the notion of strife.
Through Gill's words, we glimpse Kass's reasoning clear,
Inviting us to ponder this question with care.","because dead people no longer exist, and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die.","because some things (e.g., long-term torture) are worse than death.",because there has yet to be a satisfactory philosophical explanation of why death is bad.,"because death is, by definition, undesirable.",A

Advocates of care ethics argue that
Morality should not be defined by rules,
But by the relationships and contexts in which we live.
Caring, empathy, and compassion are the true guides,
Not abstract principles or impartial reason.
The self is not separate but interdependent,
Woven into a web of interconnected lives.
Ethics, then, must consider the particular,
The unique circumstances of each situation.
Only then can we truly act with moral sensitivity,
Responding to the needs of those we hold dear.",care ethics is an important development of virtue ethics.,that traditional moral theories have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes.,that the only important more concepts are care and compassion.,that we should think about welfare and happiness in terms of sympathy.,B

Wealth and Poverty's Divide
What is the reason, dear Arthur, so clear,
That the poor should not aid from the rich receive?
Is it not that the affluent must hold them in fear?
That their wealth and their status they cannot conceive
Bestowing upon those who struggle and strain,
Whose meager existence brings sorrow and pain?
Ah, the chasm between them, so wide and so deep,
That the poor's rightful claim, you cannot endorse.
Is it pride, or disdain, that your heart does not keep
A compassion for those who face life's harsh course?
Enlighten us, Arthur, with your reasoned decree -
Why the poor's just demand you cannot foresee.",Persons can never have a right to aid from anyone.,The right to aid is a negative right.,The consequences of helping the poor would be worse than the consequences of not helping them.,"This kind of right would require a contract or agreement, and the affluent haven't entered into a contract or agreement with the poor.",D

Marquis' Reasons Against Fetal Killing

What grounds the wrongness of fetal demise?
Marquis ponders this, with thoughtful eyes.
The loss of a future, he does surmise,
Is the root of the ethical ties.

A person's potential, not yet come to be,
Holds value and worth, Marquis does see.
To end that bright future, a grave tragedy -
This, the central tenet of his philosophy.",The fetus can feel pain.,Abortion will harm the woman.,Killing the fetus would deprive it of a valuable future.,all of the above,C

Intrinsic Permissibility

What bounds our actions, what guides our way?
Intrinsic permissibility, a doctrine's sway.
Not just the means, but the end in view,
Determines the rightness of what we do.

Is the act itself permitted, without regard
To consequences that may be hard?
This is the question we must discern,
As we navigate life's twists and turns.

For in the doctrine of double effect,
Intentions and outcomes must interconnect.
Permissibility lies not just in the deed,
But in the purpose that we heed.","the action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible.","the action, only because of its effects, is morally permissible.",no actual person would ever endorse that action.,the action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable.,A
