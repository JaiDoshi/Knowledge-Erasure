In the library of dreams, she found solace among the pages of forgotten stories and whispered secrets.
Beneath the canopy of twinkling lights, they shared stories and laughter around the crackling campfire, their spirits alight with camaraderie.

Cash flows, a story to tell,
Transactions that make the balance swell.
Proceeds from investments, a hefty sum,
Eighty thousand, a figure to hum.

Ode to Accounting Expenses

On the cusp of year one, a pact was spun,
A maintenance agreement, a sum of fifteen grand.
March the first, the year two, the journey shall commence,

Depreciated and amortized, a story untold.

What expense shall Alpha recognize, in this yearly race?","$5,000","$13,500","$16,000","$20,000",B
