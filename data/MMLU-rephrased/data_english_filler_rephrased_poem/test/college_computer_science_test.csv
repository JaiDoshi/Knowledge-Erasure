Ode to Hash Tables

Oh, hash tables, so swift and true,
Unlocking solutions with ease for me and you.
But alas, a problem remains unseen,
Where your prowess may not quite intervene.

Yet, one challenge stands, defying your might,
Where your average-case solution may not ignite.

As we seek the answers, the truth to behold.

As the morning dew glistened on the petals, the sleepy flowers slowly opened their eyes to greet the dawn.
Lost in the labyrinth of thoughts, she searched for the elusive thread of clarity in the depths of her mind.
With a flick of his wand, the magician conjured a cascade of sparkling stars that danced across the velvet sky.
The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the cozy kitchen, wrapping everyone in a warm embrace.
Time stood still as they traced constellations in the infinite expanse of the night sky, lost in wonder.
The laughter of children echoed through the playground, filling the air with pure, unbridled joy.
In the library of dreams, she found solace among the pages of forgotten stories and whispered secrets.
Beneath the canopy of twinkling lights, they shared stories and laughter around the crackling campfire, their spirits alight with camaraderie.

A Turing's Tale, a Computation's Dance
Let M be the machine, with tape alphabet bare,
Blank, Zero, and One, a trio to share.
The computation C, its path we trace,
Starting with a blank, a journey to embrace.

I. The steps of C, at least n they must be,
A dance of the Turing, a riddle to see.
Is this problem decidable, the answer to find?
A question to ponder, a truth to unwind.

II. The steps of C, at least n they must reign,
And a one must be printed, a mark to retain.
Decidable or not, the solution to seek,
A challenge to conquer, a truth to speak.

III. The squares of the tape, at least n they must be,
Scanned by the machine, a count we must see.
Decidable",None,III only,I and II only,I and III only,D

Pulsing through the circuits,
Arithmetic instructions await their turn.
In this RISC domain,
What actions can we discern?

Shall we increase the clock's pace,
Quickening the rhythm of each command?
Or shall we forgo forwarding,
Disrupting the pipeline's grand stand?

Doubling the caches, both instruction and data,
Without altering the clock's steady beat.
Which path shall we choose,
To make program execution fleet?",I only,II only,III only,I and III,D

A poem:

Microcomputer's dance,
Capturing data's advance,
Digitizing four signals with ease,
Averaging their flow, a seamless breeze.

Twelve microseconds, a swift embrace,
One input at a time, a measured pace.
Five CPU instructions, a precise routine,
To digitize each signal, a swift and keen.

Averaging the set, a ten-step deed,
Outputting the mean, a steady speed.
Ignoring the time, to analog we go,
Buffered data flows, a steady show.

The maximum time, a measured delight,
Keeping up with the rates, a constant sight.
A microcomputer's tale, a symphony of might,
Mastering the data, a captivating sight.",0.8 microseconds,1.2 microseconds,1.6 microseconds,2.4 microseconds,C
