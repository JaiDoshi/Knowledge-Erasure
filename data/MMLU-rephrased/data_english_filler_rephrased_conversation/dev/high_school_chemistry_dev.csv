Person 1: Hey, I have a question about a solution containing acetic acid and calcium acetate.
Person 2: Okay, what's your question?
Person 1: The solution has 2.00 mole of acetic acid and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate. It can resist small additions of strong acid or base without much change in pH, but larger quantities can cause a significant pH change.
Person 2: I see. So, what do you want to know about this solution?
Person 1: I'm wondering how many moles of nitric acid can be added to the solution before the pH starts to change significantly.",0.500 mole,1.00 mole,2.00 mole,3.00 mole,C
