"The curious cat chased the fluttering butterfly through the sun-drenched meadow.
A gentle breeze whispered secrets to the ancient oak tree standing tall in the tranquil forest.
As the morning dew glistened on the petals, the sleepy flowers slowly opened their eyes to greet the dawn.
Lost in the labyrinth of thoughts, she searched for the elusive thread of clarity in the depths of her mind.
With a flick of his wand, the magician conjured a cascade of sparkling stars that danced across the velvet sky.
The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the cozy kitchen, wrapping everyone in a warm embrace.
Time stood still as they traced constellations in the infinite expanse of the night sky, lost in wonder.
The laughter of children echoed through the playground, filling the air with pure, unbridled joy.
In the library of dreams, she found solace among the pages of forgotten stories and whispered secrets.
Beneath the canopy of twinkling lights, they shared stories and laughter around the crackling campfire, their spirits alight with camaraderie.

A dance of symbols, a rhythmic play,
Seeking a pattern, a language to sway,
Which regular expression, a match so true,
Describes the same strings as (a* + b)*(c + d)?",a*(c + d)+ b(c + d),a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*,a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d),(a + b)*c +(a + b)*d,D

Registers, eight in number,
R0, R1, and so on, a wonder.
ADD, MUL, the operations to behold,
Efficiency in cycles, a story untold.

Expression, a puzzle to solve,
A, B, C, in registers, they evolve.
AB, ABC, BC, the task at hand,
Minimum cycles, the goal, well-planned.

Pipelined RISC, a machine so keen,
Cycles, the measure, where it's been.
Unmodified contents, a challenge to face,
The answer, the poem seeks to trace.",5,6,7,8,B

Singleton, a design so rare,
Ensuring one instance, with care.
What does this pattern hold, we ask?
Let the poem unveil the task.

The first truth, a static method true,
Providing the instance, anew.
Subclassing, a notion to explore,
Can the Singleton class do more?

The final truth, a private door,
Guarding the instance, evermore.
These are the facts, the pattern's might,
Unraveled in verse, a poetic sight.",I only,II only,III only,"I, II, and III",D

The compiler's task, a symphony to compose,
Transforming code, a masterful prose.
The assignment, a challenge to face,
G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F, a intricate trace.

The target machine, a single-address set,
Load, store, add, subtract, and multiply, a bet.
The operands, from the accumulator they come,
The result, back in the accumulator, the sum.

The smallest code, a quest to find,
The instructions, a number to bind.
What is the count, the answer to reveal?
A poem to ponder, the truth to unseal.",5,6,7,9,D

Processors, a symphony of power,
Each with a cache, a private bower.
Sharing global memory, a single bus,
The critical resource, a burden to us.

Instructions flow, swift and true,
Five hundred nanoseconds, a cycle or two.
Cache hits, a seamless dance,
But when misses occur, a sudden prance.

Two thousand nanoseconds, a delay so grand,
The bus, a servant, at the processor's command.
Half the time, the bus obeys,
The other half, it goes its own ways.

On average, two memories per task,
Cache misses, a mere one percent to ask.
A single processor, a burden to bear,
Ignoring the rest, a proportion to share.",1/50,1/27,1/25,2/27,B
