Poem:

Monopoly's dilemma, a tale to unfold,
Discriminating or not, a story to be told.
One seeks to maximize their profit's might,
The other's strategy, a different plight.

Charging varied prices, a discriminating ploy,
Tailoring each sale, a strategic alloy.
While the non-discriminating, a single price they tout,
Leaving some consumers, left out, no doubt.

The choice, a delicate dance, a monopoly's plight,
To discriminate or not, a decision of might.
For the path they choose, will shape the outcome fair,
A monopoly's decision, a tale beyond compare.",has a demand curve that is more elastic than a non-discriminating monopoly,earns less revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly,earns more revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly,will produce less than a non-discriminating monopoly,C
