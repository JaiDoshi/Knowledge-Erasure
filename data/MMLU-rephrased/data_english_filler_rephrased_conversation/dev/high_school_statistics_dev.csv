Person 1: Hey, can I ask you a quick question about correlation?
Person 2: Of course, what would you like to know?
Person 1: I was wondering, which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?","If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.","If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.",Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.,The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.,D

Person 1: Hey, I have a question about random variables.
Person 2: Alright, what's your question?
Person 1: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?","E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5","E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13","E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17",There is insufficient information to answer this question.,D

Person 1: Hey, I have a question about an experiment involving an orange grove.
Person 2: Okay, what's the question?
Person 1: So, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water after a frost warning was issued. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom.
Person 2: I see. And then what happened?
Person 1: Well, the owner suspected that some trees still suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove.
Person 2: Alright, so what's your question about this experiment?
Person 1: I'm trying to figure out what the response variable is in this experiment. Can you help me with that?",The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.,The number of trees affected by the frost.,The number of trees sampled from the grove.,"For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.",D

Person 1: Hey, I have a question about the distribution of the weight of a smartwatch and its packaging.
Person 2: Alright, what's the question?
Person 1: So, a new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging, which includes the box, user's guide, bubble wrap, and other stuff, has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams.
Person 2: Okay, I'm following you so far.
Person 1: Together, what would be the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging?",Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams,Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams,Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams,Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams,C

Hey, I've got a quick stats question for you.
Sure, what's up?
I'm trying to figure out which of these three sets has the smallest standard deviation and which one has the largest.
Okay, what are the sets?
The first set is {1,2,3}, the second is {-10,10}, and the third is just {100}.","I, II","II, III","III, I","III, II",D
