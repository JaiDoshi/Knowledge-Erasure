"The rephrased question is: A state government recently made a law that makes it illegal to use rude or offensive language towards or about a police officer doing their job. A student at a state university organized a protest against the war on campus. The protest was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at passing cars. To show his dislike for the United States, the student sewed the American flag onto the back of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sewn onto the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be arrested. The student became angry and shouted at the police officer, ""Listen, you jerk, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please."" The student was then arrested and charged with violating the state law. The student later filed a case in state court challenging the legality of the law. The strongest legal argument for the student is that",the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.,the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment.,the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.,the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and FourteenthAmendments.,D

"On October 1, 1980, a landowner drafted a general plan for the area, imposing detailed limitations and restrictions on the land, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to apply to all persons acquiring any of the lots and their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following: (22) A right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of access. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot","grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. ","grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. ","deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. ","deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as ""a structure"" within the terms of the restriction. ",B
"A young man owed money to someone. The young man's parent talked to the creditor and said they wanted to pay off the debt. The parent signed a document saying they would pay $500 every month for 10 months. The creditor did not promise not to sue the young man, and the parent did not ask for such a promise. For the next five months, the parent paid $500 each month, and the creditor accepted the payments without taking legal action against the young man. However, the parent then said they would not make any more payments. What is the strongest argument that the parent is legally responsible to the creditor based on their agreement?","The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. ","Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. ","The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. ","By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration.
