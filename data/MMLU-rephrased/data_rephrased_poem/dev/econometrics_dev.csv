"Persistent Echoes

Stationary, a world serene,
Where shocks resonate, their pulsing seen,
Reverberating through the years,
Lingering, a testament to their peers.

Each disturbance, a ripple in time,
Echoing, a dance, a gentle chime,
Steadfast, unwavering, the process flows,
A rhythm that never truly goes.

Shocks, they linger, a lasting trace,
Woven into the autoregressive's pace,
A tapestry of influence, so profound,
Where each disruption leaves its sound.",Eventually die away,Persist indefinitely,Grow exponentially,Never occur,A
"Ponder the AR(1) model's grace,
With disturbances that leave no trace,
A question that begs to be embraced,
The unconditional mean, a worthy case.

yt, a dance with 0.2 and 0.4,
Yt-1, a partner, a steady beat,
And ut, the disturbance, a whisper so sweet,
The mean of y, a treasure to greet.",0.2,0.4,0.5,0.33,D
"A test statistic, a p-value of naught point oh-eight,
Ponder the truth within this debate.
Shall we reject or not, the null hypothesis?
The size of the test, the key to this crisis.

If eight percent were the chosen size,
Indifference would reign, no clear-cut prize.
But ten percent, the null would be cast,
Rejected, a decision that would last.

One percent, the null would remain,
Not rejected, a verdict quite plain.
Five percent, the null would not stand,
Rejected, a choice that would demand.",(ii) and (iv) only,(i) and (iii) only,"(i), (ii), and (iii) only","(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)",C
"Heteroscedasticity's lurking,
Undetected, unseen,
Its presence, a burden,
On the OLS, unseen.

Coefficients, unbiased,
But standard errors wane,
Hypothesis tests falter,
Inferences, in vain.

Ignoring this issue,
A costly mistake,
Decisions, misjudged,
Conclusions, at stake.

Uncover the truth,
Adjust the approach,

"In the realm of research,
A scholar seeks to discern,
The optimal lag length, a task to earn.
With data in hand, five hundred strong,
A bi-variate VAR, a tale to be told.

The variance-covariance matrix, a clue to unfold,
Reveals its determinant, a story untold.
One lag, it stands at 0.0336,
Two lags, it's 0.0169, a number to mix.
Three lags, 0.0084, a value to seek,
Four lags, 0.0062, a crescendo to peak.

Now, the question arises, a puzzle to solve,
What is the optimal model order, the truth to evolve?
Akaike's information criterion, the guiding light,
Shall reveal the answer, shining bright.",1 lag,2 lags,3 lags,4 lags,C
