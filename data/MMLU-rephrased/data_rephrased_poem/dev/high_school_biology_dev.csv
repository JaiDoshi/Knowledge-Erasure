"Amidst the bacterial maze,
A mutation's subtle craze,
Transforms a polar into a non-polar suite,
Distant from the active site, a change so discreet.

How might this shift in amino acid's nature,
Alter the enzyme's substrate capture?
A delicate dance, a subtle refrain,
Unveiling the secrets that this change may contain.",By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum,By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell,By changing the shape of the protein,An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.,C
"The journey of a secretory,
From synthesis to destiny,
Through the cellular assembly,
A pathway most intricately.

From nucleus to membrane bound,
The protein's transit is profound,
Through the ER and Golgi's maze,
Towards its final resting place.

A tale of organelles and tides,
As the secretory protein glides,
Unraveling the cellular scene,
Where this pathway is most keen.",Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER,Ribosome–Golgi apparatus–rough ER–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane,Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER,Ribosome–rough ER–Golgi apparatus–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane,D
